<P>So you can say I almost did it! My second dream was to drive across U.S.
to Grand Canyon. Aim for the stars and at&nbsp; the least you'll land
on the rooftop. Well I drove across&nbsp; U.S. all right, but by the time
I reached near Grand Canyon, I had seen so many other canyons, mountains, and
rocks on the way that I wanted to see no more of them for some more time.
So I went straight to Las Vegas instead for a grand finale!
Even though the mission didn't get acomplished fully,
the trip was one in a lifetime - 12 days, a zillion gallons of
gas, staying in every type of motel and camps, tasting
every kind of food on the way, and best of all getting to see
almost every form of landscapes and people there are to see in this
vast country.
<P>So this is how it started. I had to reach Berkeley (near San Francisco)
by the middle of September on a project for next one year. Being a
grad student in U.S., one needs the penny pinching mentality to survive
here and I was trying to relocate between two of the costliest places
in this country. With my bank balance hardly enough to 
ship my car 3500 miles across the country&nbsp; it didn't
take much time for me to figure out what the best option would be
to reach my destination - drive myself to San Francisco.
<P>Well, wanting to do something interesting is one thing. Getting a
consensus on doing it is another. Why do you need
a consensus for a single person? Well you do esspecially if
you are the youngest in the family with many guardian angels
looking after your welfare. Honestly, I am glad and thankful
I have so many guardian angels and going by their advice,
I needed to find an experienced partner to travel along. I needed to
leave by September 1st to reach San Francisco on time and with just
a week left for before my trip, there still wasn't anyone willing to
come along. I couldn't expect much either. With the new semester
just getting kicked off, who would like to miss classes, drive
3500 miles across the country, and fly back immediately to achieve
a net displacement of zero in terms of distance but a big displacement
in terms of bank balance?
<P>They say that if you want something really badly, miracles happen.
And&nbsp; a week before the D-day I found just the person who would
do all of the above except miss classes - since he had just graduated from
being a grad student to teaching these poor souls. Pedro was
a Ph.D. student in our lab and graduated just a few months earlier.
Like all Professors, he had decided that academic life was more
interesting than real world! So he went back to his teaching position
in Portugal. Now on vacation in U.S. he had plans to go further
north to explore the wilderness of Canada. But desparate as I was,
I gave the it a long shot and asked him to drive with me instead
across the country. Ask and thou shall receive - I have never seen
anyone agree more promptly :) Rest is history.
<P>Coping with my crazy last week at summer internship, I managed
to get my car tuned up and wrap my belongings at Stony Brook. Me and
Pedro paid a visit to local AAA office asked the poor guy at the office
to carefully plan out two separate routes across the country for our
drive from NY to SF in 10 days visiting as many interesting places as we
could.
Shaking his head in despair, the AAA man took out a big map of united
states, marked out every road we'd have to take on the way ( most of
which we never followed) and carefully placed green circles along the path
on places that would be interesting to stop by.
<P>My car is a '95 Hyundai Accent 2-door hatchback and it was a feat of
extremely careful engineering to have both mine and Pedro's belongings
packed into the pseudo-trunk and the back-seat of the car. Every item had
a specific place to fit in and nowhere else to go. A loaded 2-door hatchback
is not the best companion to go long-distance travelling, but it was
the best we had and it proved to be good enough.
<P>The route we chose was close to the longest one could take to reach
a place diagonally across the country. First we were to go west half the way
from NY, then north west towards Yellowstone further away from our
destination, then straight down south to Grand Canyon and then up northwest
again to San Francisco. Armed with tourbooks and campbooks
for almost every state on the way, and a big National Geographic Road
Atlas, we set out on our mission.

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR><FONT SIZE=3>The
day before we left, me and Pedro visited the local malls and bought
an odd assortment of items ranging from a hammer, some spanners,
cooling bag, a rain repellent coating for car's windshield, and lots
of eatables for the way. In my hurry I had forgotten to buy a camera,
but since I had a disposable one for the moment from my earlier visit
to a Mets/Cardinals game in NY, I decided not to worry about it till
later in the trip.  How could one miss out a camera from shopping
list before leaving on such a trip?? ... well, that's me :) </FONT>

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><BR><FONT SIZE=3>Saturday morning of
28th Sept. we were all set to go. I bade goodbye to my housemates and
we drove off to the nearest gas station where I bought a gauge to
measure tyre pressure. It was a nice, sunny and perfect day to set
out on the trip. We took the Northern State Parkway out of Long
Island into New York City. Once we joined the road leading to George
Washington Bridge, the going was really slow at the rate of 10 miles
per hour.  It was to be the slowest drives in the whole trip. I am
not a great fan of New York traffic and was glad to be getting away
from it for a long long time. Driving on the upper deck of GW Bridge,
I got my last sight of the impressive Manhattan skyline</FONT>. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>We took Route 80, which
actually goes all the way west to San Francisco if you bother never
to get out of it. But that's not really what an adventure is made of,
is it? Our destination for the day was to reach my brother's place in
Penn State University by the evening. The drive through New Jersey
was absolutely boring. Only thing good about the drive is that the
gas prices are one of the lowest I have seen anywhere in U.S.  But
then they offset it by charging tolls once too often.  Once we
decided to stop for lunch, it was impossible to find an exit  with a
decent food joint. Finally we located a Diner and Pedro decided to
try out American chilli for the first time. It proved to be hot in
both ways - spicy and burnt his tongue! I stuck to a good old
omelette. Another stop at a CITGO gas station, which was run by a
sardarji, and we entered Pennsylvania. This part of the trip was much
better with a great drive through the lush green hills. I started
clicking away with my disposable camera. It was more or less an
uneventful drive the first day and we reached State College by 7:00
in the evening where my brother Venkat ( or Venky as we call him) and
his wife Veena stay. Veena had cooked a great multi-course Indian
dinner in anticipation of our arrival. Her cooking skills are
absolutely incomparable and this was the last proper dinner we were
to have for rest of the trip! The VVs showed great interest in our
trip plan and the places we were to visit on the way, and Venky's
refrain was that he was envious of and happy for me as I was doing
what he had long wanted to do. </FONT>

</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=3>Early
morning next day, we bid our goodbyes, bought some foodstuffs and
drove out of State College with the arrangement that I was to call
VVs every night wherever I stopped on the way. See...guardian angels
:)  It was a long drive out to the border of Pennsylvania as the
state is really wide! Route 80 itself is quite beautiful in this
stretch but we decided to explore further and took side roads, which
basically ran parallel to the interstate but passed through
countryside towns and villages. There were signs of deer crossing all
along the roads, but the only deer we saw were those that had been
run over by some passing vehicle. Too bad. Towards the western border
of Pennsylvania, the hills began to fade away and were replaced by a
more regular terrain</FONT>.  
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Next we entered Ohio and
we were again on the interstate 80, with traffic much sparser and
consisting mostly of trucks. Pedro and myself had been swapping our
driving turns whenever we stopped for gas, food or at rest areas. The
rest areas for public are really neat along the highways, something
that impressed me a lot. Some even have free coffee for sleepy
drivers! Neither of us had really stretched the vehicle very much,
partly because of the speed limit and also because we were aware that
it was loaded - you could say it was &quot;back heavy&quot;. On the
stretch of Ohio, the limit got higher around 70 mph and I figured out
that a loaded Hyundai could do 80 mph plus with ease. With good
reason Pedro kept warning me to slow down.  Pedro: &quot;After
reaching San Francisco, drive at whatever speed you want, but not on
the way!” </FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT><BR><FONT SIZE=3>Me: &quot;Yes
sir!” </FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>We had been on the
interstate for too long and wanted to take some side roads. Pedro
decided to navigate by intuition and gave me directions to drive in
the general direction towards north</FONT>.  
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>Me: &quot;Hey,
do you know where exactly we are on the map right now?”</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3>Pedro: &quot;No.&quot; But don't worry. Just keep
driving as I tell you?”</FONT> <BR><FONT SIZE=3>Me: &quot;Have you
been here before?”</FONT> <BR><FONT SIZE=3>Pedro: &quot;No.&quot;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3>Me: &quot;Huh?!</FONT>&quot; 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=3>And so we
went on, driving through a lot of side roads. For the benefit of
those readers outside U.S., each road in this country is identified
by a number, as you must have figured out by now. I choose not to
list them in this account for obvious reasons of that being
uninteresting...so you'll find the phrase &quot;we drove through lot
of side roads&quot; recurring throughout my accounts</FONT>. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly I found myself
driving by the shore of what appeared to be a sea?  For a moment I
was zapped since I thought we were driving towards the middle of U.S.
 Soon I figured out that this was Lake Erie, one of the five in Grate
Lakes region and also the source of famous Niagara Falls that I had
visited a few weeks earlier. I now gained a healthy respect for
Pedro's sense of direction. Later throughout the trip, whenever we
entered a new township or city, I'd give over the controls to Pedro.
He would locate the downtown for the town in no time using his `sixth
sense' and take us where the action in the town really was. Cool</FONT>.

</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>The shores of Lake Erie
seemed to be inhabited by rich people. There were many private
beaches and sporting activity seemed to abound. Quite a beautiful
area. We reached Sheldon where there is a protected area called
&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Lake%20Eerie%20area-Brown%20marshlands%20.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Brown
Marshlands</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;. I had never seen
a marshland before so this was a new experience. This area is known
for rare birds, insects and plants. The air was filled with sounds of
crickets. Walk along a mile of narrow road took us along the sides of
the marshland. Brown surface of marshes were absolutely plain without
any frills and from a distance, it was hard to tell whether it was
solid land or just some dirt covering the surface of a pond. The road
led to Lake Erie. We hung around for a while around an abandoned NASA
pumping station by the shore and while running to escape some waves,
I almost disposed off my disposable camera into water.  </FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Found our way back to
route 80 and just drove then onwards towards Elkhart, Indiana where
we had booked a room in Best Western Inn for the night.  Another
feature peculiar to the stretch of roads this far was that we had to
pay tolls very frequently all along route 80. The more toll they
charged, the worse the roads used to be. Thus far, all trucks in Penn
and Ohio used to stay on the right lane and travelled well below
speed limit.  This gave me the impression that truckers in this
country are really well behaved and care about safe driving. Once we
entered Indiana, it seemed as if cops don't patrol these highways at
all. For the first time in the whole trip, we had trucks</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=3>overtaking us at 90 mph. More trucks overtook us at
higher speeds in this stretch than anywhere in the whole trip did. 
And for those who don't know, trucks in this country are really big
and long.... not like the rickety small ones that speed on India's
highways. Passing by a truck, you feel like you are passing by a
train ... okay I am exaggerating but that kind of sums up the way it
feels to be driving besides one of these dinosaurs. </FONT>

</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Anyway, we reached
safely at Elkhart. The inn was nice and had even had an indoor
swimming pool. Pedro, a swimming enthusiast, had his face lit up at
the news but soon changed his mind when he saw that it was a small
pool and even that had a bunch of kids jumping around in water. We
moved into our room, checked out the weather for next day which
seemed okay, but had rain predicted later in the week in our journey,
had dinner outside and planned our trip next day to Chicago and
Madison. </FONT>

30th August<BR></U></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>We started off from
Elkhart after a continental breakfast at the inn and headed straight
to Chicago. Chicago and New York had very similar histories. Both are
supposed to have started as an industrial township. Chicago basically
had coal and oil industries. It was also the centre of labour
struggles. Later, as happens to all industrial towns, Chicago and NY
evolved to be strong financial trading centres in U.S. As we got into
the outskirts of Chicago, it had dull grey and uninviting looks with
industries dotting the horizon. There were huge power cables going
into the city from all directions in the sky and innumerable trucks
heading into the city from all directions on the road</FONT>.  
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>We drove further inside
the city where people seemed to have houses and soon were on neat
roads. We drove on one by the side of Lake Michigan and stopped for a
while by the lake to get a view of the Chicago skyline. In lakeside
areas people seemed relaxed and laid back even at 11:00 in the
morning of a Monday. No one seemed to be in a hurry.  The main
feature of the city was the distinct skyscrapers. Each was amazingly
shaped. The typical </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Chicago%201.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Chicago
architecture</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3> seemed</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Chicago%202.jpg">Chicago

tapering tops piercing into the sky - each one making a loud
statement of its glory</FONT>. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3>We parked our car in a public parking
and started walking around. I took lots of pictures - mainly
buildings. Since I was still using my disposable camera, one of our
goals in Chicago was to buy a good camera. Pedro seemed very excited
and rushed around from street to street as if he knew the place. I
got a good exercise chasing him! In the process I saw a lot more of
downtown Chicago than I would have seen by myself.  A funny and queer
thing about Chicago is that they have <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Chicago-statues%20of%20cows.jpg">statues
of cows</A></U></FONT> all over the downtown. Each cow is painted
with funny colours and patterns.  One had all its internals
illustrated like assembly line of a factory where milk is produced
and the process it goes through! Some sense of humour! </FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>After a lot of running
around, we visited a local AAA office to get more maps, and I finally
bought a proper camera - a simple point and shoot Konica with zoom
and some extra focussing features. We left Chicago around lunchtime
with lot of crowd getting out of their offices and headed towards
Madison in Wisconsin.  Wisconsin didn't seem to have many big cities.
The only other prominent city seemed to be Milwaukee. Madison itself
is a very small city. It has the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Madison%20WI-The%20Capitol.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>state
capitol</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3> whose dome dominates the
city skyline according to city's laws. The stretch of Capitol is
sandwiched between two big lakes and is very beautiful. Small
residential area surrounds the capitol building. The whole city
seemed extremely laidback and sleepy. The University of Wisconsin at
Madison too is by one of the lakes. Again we parked our car and
started walking around the streets and visited the banks of each of
the lakes. </FONT>

</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>As the evening hours
started approaching, the streets became much livelier.  A lot of
undergraduate crowd, probably freshmen joining in the Fall, appeared
on the streets from nowhere and soon it was a party atmosphere by the
shopping streets and restaurants. A lot of houses belonged to
fraternities and sororities named as Alpha Kappa Lamda, and whatever
combinations of any three Greek letter you can make out. Fresh kids
in college hung out on the balconies and shouted across to each
other.  One of the houses appeared burnt - probably a drunken
Saturday night party</FONT>! 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>We left Madison around
sunset and headed towards La Crosse where we planned to stay for the
night. Part of the way, we took a smaller side road and were rewarded
with the sight of a beautiful countryside with glorious sunset over
its cornfields. Unfortunately, I had no more film rolls with me: ( 
We passed through Baraboo and Sauk City which were small sleepy
townships with an economy depending on tourists and passing traffic
on the highway. Went by a casino which had amazingly large number of
cars parked in its parking lot for the sparsely populated
countryside. For the first time we had a taste of night driving for a
couple of hours.  We reached La Crosse at night. It’s a small town
by the border of Wisconsin and Minnesota. We checked into a motel,
had dinner at Pizza Hut and went off to sleep. Plan for next day -
drive across Minnesota - &quot;The Land of 10000 Lakes&quot;. </FONT>

</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Woke up at La Crosse and
left the motel after breakfast.  We picked up some more eatables form
a local grocery store where the people were friendlier than I had
seen so far in the trip. We roamed around a sleepy township, which
wasn't up even at 10:00 a.m. We went to the banks of junction where
three rivers -Mississippi, Black, and La Crosse - meet each other.
There was a </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Native%20Indian%20-%20La%20Crosse.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>huge
statue of Hawaiatha native Indian</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>
by the river. So I stood in front of the statue and Pedro took a snap
of an alien Indian standing in front of a native Indian! Also went
through a small museum, which had the history of La Crosse.
Apparently the French were the first from Europe to arrive in the
area and they set up lots of lumber businesses around the place. 
Mississippi River served as a means of transporting the timber to
downstream locations</FONT>. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>We drove out of La
Crosse and into Minnesota. The number plates on the car ahead of us
declared &quot;Minnesota - a land of 10000 lakes&quot;.  Indeed we
saw many lakes along the places we passed by. Northern part of the
state is supposed to be more scenic and from the maps it appeared to
have more lakes. But we were driving along the southern border of
Minnesota and this region was mostly great plains and prairies. It
was miles and miles of farmhand as far as eyes could see. Around
noon, we stopped by a small mid-western town named Albert Lea.  It
was a somewhat run-down small township besides a lake. This town had
many flat roofed concrete buildings, many of them painted bright red,
which was different since most towns in eastern side have wooden
houses with tiled, tapering roof.  We went to a local post office
where Pedro wanted to mail something. While he was in line, I had a
good time observing a confident and cute 2-year old native Indian kid
giving his mom a hard time by trying to pull off all booklets and
envelops within his reach</FONT>. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>We checked out a small
family-run pizza shop. The hostess was nice and friendly. Apparently
not many foreigners or &quot;out of towners&quot; come to this town.
So she asked as to where we were from. When I mentioned Long Island,
she immediately started talking about the JFK Junior's plane crash
near LI and how sad she felt for him. JFK Junior seemed to be a
heartthrob among women in America. More than once I have heard
American women reminiscing about him fondly. The pizza was good and
we tipped her well!</FONT> 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Off we drove out of
Albert Lea towards a place called Sioux Falls.  We didn't know
whether there were any falls at all. Tour Book mentioned a Falls park
in the city. So we went. About 50 miles before Sioux Falls, we
decided to take a small sideroad. This road had no signs as to where
it went or where all those turns lead to.  So we stopped by a small
run down gas station. The area seemed quite poor with mostly local
trucks stopping by. The girl at the station<BR>filled the gas and
cleaned the car's windshield. When I asked for directions to Sioux
Falls, she called her friend from inside. The reason I mention these
details is that this second girl had green eyes - the greenest I have
ever seen in a human being. That combined with her serious looks
appeared really spooky. While she explained the route to us in a
heavy mid-west accent, the first girl got a souvenir for us from
inside - it was a plastic tablet with the name of the gas station
painted on it.  &quot;Its something for you remember us by. We don't
see that many out of towners around here!&quot; Pedro and me had a
small contest later as to who gets to keep the souvenir...I did</FONT>!</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Pedro wasn't convinced
that the directions we got took on through an interesting route. So
as soon as we got out of the gas station, he promptly took another
route and drove by intuition. As always, his intuition was right. We
passed by beautiful farmlands and reached Sioux Falls City. This was
a somewhat bigger city with much more activity around evening time. I
was still wondering if there were any falls around the place. We took
directions to the falls park and came across </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Sioux%20Falls.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>a
small waterfall</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3> with a nicely
maintained park around it. There wasn't much water around this time
of year. We hung around for a while and climbed a tower nearby to get
a view of the city. Sioux Falls started off as an industrial township
that grew around the Big Sioux River.  Now it was a prominent
business centre. There used to be a seven storeyed wheat processing
mill besides the water fall in early 20th century that derived its
power using water from the falls. They still had the ruins of the
mill. Pretty cool stuff for that time</FONT>.  
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=3>Drove
around a little bit more and left the city by taking a small side
road.  Somewhat rough road with no traffic in sight for miles and
miles. Just plain farmlands. At places I saw some storage towers and
farmers' houses nearby. I was wondering how it would be living in one
of these places and had a strong urge to stop by one of these
farmhouses and stay there for a week or so in their lifestyle. But
that would have to wait for sometime later. Right <BR>now I was in a
rush to go across the country and could only hope for a glimpse of
this remote life. I was rewarded with another </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Sunset%20on%20the%20way%20to%20Chamberlain.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>beautiful

time I promptly took photographs</FONT>. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>We joined interstate 90
and drove to Chamberlain. It’s a town by Missouri River - basically
a tourist attraction. We had not booked a place this night so we
hunted around till we came across </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="South%20Dakota-our%20hotel%20at%20Chamberlain.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>a
somewhat expensive inn called Cedar Shores</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>
just on the scenic banks of Missouri. Pedro and me were in a dilemma
whether to take the room at such an expensive place and decided it
was probably worth it. Resolved to camp the following nights to make
up for it! I took a shower at the room, had dinner, and I went out to
the river shore while Pedro decided to go off to sleep. After
spending some time by the shore watching the reflection of town's
lights in Missouri's flowing waters, I went back to the room
resolving to get up early the next morning to catch the sunrise</FONT>.

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Soon we were driving
westwards again on interstate 90 towards Badlands. This stretch of
South Dakota is again basically lots of farms and grasslands. As we
kept driving along the monotonous terrain, I began wondering whether
the famed beauty of South Dakota was overhype. But one thing I learnt
on this trip is never to underestimate the power of this land to
shake you out of slumber with the power of magnificent contrasts and
surprises. I came upon the contrast I wouldn't forget in a hurry.
Amid miles of grasslands and farms, a group of naked cliffs jut into
sky to present an amazing contrast. These are the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="South%20Dakota%20-%20Badlands.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Badlands</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>,

independently named it as Badlands since they couldn't use the land
for any purpose. Later this place was found to be rich in dinosaur
and other <BR>ancient fossils and became a protected region. This
terrain very much resembles the Chambal Valley in India, probably
only more colourful.  Our first sight was a </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="South%20Dakota,%20view%20from%20top%20of%20Badlands.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>splendid

sediments to erode over half a million years and exposed various

well maintained roads took us on a loop around and into Badlands with
many places to stop for scenic overlooks.  There were many hiking
trails going into the heart of the hills and I wished I could stay
longer and go along one of these - but I was just passing by this
place – couldn’t afford to stay longer.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>We left badlands towards
Rapid City. Badlands followed us a long way and slowly faded into
grasslands. We drove into Rapid City around 3:00 p.m. and Pedro
quickly located its downtown with his action sensing radar. This
place seemed to have less population than Sioux Falls City but had
more activity and liveliness. This place had lots of shops and
streets with German sounding names but I couldn’t figure out if it
had any German historical influence. <BR>Lots of students seemed to
be walking around in streets, many with painting canvasses and
musical instruments. We entered a small restaurant and ordered Cafe
Mocha and sat observing the strange place. The restaurant was a
bright place with had lots of modernist paintings hanging on the
walls. A shelf in the corner had a bunch of books on philosophy and
art. On one side were a bunch of computers with somebody trying to
set up network connection among them. A student sat in a table in
front of us reading seriously. Someone upstairs was practising loud
guitar, again and again going over the same tune trying to get it
right. There was a bunch of CDs on sale with songs from some local
band. A group of teens entered the place who seemed very friendly and
happy - they seemed to know everyone around the restaurant ... this
seemed like a local hangout for these kids more than a restaurant. A
happy place that felt good and which somehow stood out in my memory
of the whole trip</FONT>. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>We left Rapid City and
entered Black Hills nearby where there's </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Four%20Presidents%20on%20Mt.Rushmore.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Mount
Rushmore</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3> with the faces of four
presidents carved out on a steep rock cliff. It was close to evening
and Black Hills looked really black - they are thickly wooded with
dark green pine trees. We encountered steep curvy mountain roads for
the first time in the trip and this was the beginning of a long
mountain-driving test that my car was to survive through for the rest
of the trip. We reached Mount Rushmore and had a </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="More%20of%20the%20Four.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>look
at the faces of presidents</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3> from
various vantage points. It seemed like such a crazy idea to carve out
faces of presidents on a rock cliff in a virtually no-man's land.
Apparently this was a big national project at the time it was done
and South Dakota's official slogan now read &quot;Great Places, Great
Faces!&quot;. There was even a mini demonstration by a guide that
explained how the faces were sculpted on the rock face. <BR>It began
raining and we decided to head out of the place. First drive through
rain in our journey. Black Hills are a great place to drive through.
We stopped at scenic </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Man-made%20reservoir%20at%20Black%20Hill.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Potoma
Reservoir</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3> that fed water to Rapid
City and surroundings</FONT>. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Our next stop was
Deadwood. A small township, but very strange place. Situated in the
middle of Black Hills, it is more of a tourist township with a
thriving Casino business. It started out as a gold mining township
and soon gambling became the favorite pastime for the folks. They
have legends all over the town about different great gamblers who
inhabited the town and their famous stories. There was a monument for
one such guy who, the stone claimed, was shot to death by some other
gambler. The nightlife in the town was just picking up when we
arrived there. Many casinos had flashy cars outside as rewards for
winning a jackpot.  Many old men and women dressed fashionably roamed
around and seemed to be having a good time at these places</FONT>. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Driving out of Deadwood
and onto the interstate, I felt a strange feeling - like I was Alice
in Wonderland - jumping into one rabbit hole after another with a
different fairyland in each hole, a different experience. I was
entering one strange place after another, each a completely unique
emotional experience and quickly getting out of it, all packed into
such a short period of time. Felt like I was looking at all this from
way up above in the sky, and it seemed such a strange world to have
such different things packed in a small place called Earth!
Interstates roads seemed like the only a long, lonely and sane places
on this planet.  We drove into Spear Fish where we had a room booked
and rested for the night</FONT>.

Got out of Spear Fish. It was a cloudy morning and was threatening to
rain.  We drove into Wyoming with our final destination for the day

had yellow and wavy appearance. The trees and hills had a ghostlike

describe the morning as it was but it had a bewitching beauty. And
since Pedro was in charge of the wheels, I got myself busy clicking
pictures even through the dew that started forming on the windshield</FONT>.

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>We drove through
Gillette, which is an oil and coal town. Like all industrial towns,
it had a shabby appearance. An unmanned gas station there wouldn't
accept my credit card.  A railroad station nearby didn't seem to have

at the tip of Rocky Mountain ranges. Another small <BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Wyoming-more%20of%20the%20midwestern%20town.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Midwest

between native Indians and westerners. Most Indians got butchered in
the wars and now the surviving descendants live in reservations. It
had a war memorial for everyone from the town who had died in a fight
ever since the American civil war. Had lunch at a restaurant called
Busy Bee restaurant. It was a small homely restaurant where lots of
old timers seemed to hang around. Everyone knew everyone else and we
seemed to be the only strangers around the place. It was a
particularly cold day that morning and I had to pull out my sweaters.
Pedro had apparently come unprepared for this cold - something that
struck me later as quite strange for a person initially planning to
travel in Canada!  But he insisted on roaming around in shorts and
T-shirt! Brave man :)</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT> 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>We stopped for coffee at
another shop. The girl there was friendly and while preparing our
Cappuccino she told us stories about her trip to India and China. &quot;So

&quot;Wow! That's along way from New York. So, you'll be visiting the

</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>We got directions to go
to Thermopolis from the girl and headed out of Buffalo.  Soon we
drove into </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Wyoming-Big%20Horn%20National%20Forest.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Big
Horn national forests</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>. These were
similar to Black forests with mountains at high elevation. As we went
higher, we ran into thick cloud cover.  Visibility was poor again but
it seemed like a dream driving through those clouds <BR>with only
ghostly outlines of the forest and the mountains visible to us. At
the highest elevation (exactly 9666 feet!), we got a great clear view
of the hills.  From this point onwards, we kept driving downhill.
Suddenly we found ourselves driving through the middle of a creek
with steep rocky walls jutting out on both sides and a small stream
flowing through the middle. This, I later found is, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Wyoming-Powder%20River%20Pass.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>the

the town of Tensleep. We just had to stop and get out on many of the
pullouts along the road where I took many pictures of <BR>the creek.
The road wound down along its walls and finally passed through the
bottom of the creek providing views of the creek from every angle</FONT>.
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=3>Immediately
after Tensleep, we drove through a long stretch of Route 16 between
Tensleep and Worland. This stretch presented a stark contrast to the
lush green Bighorn forests. At first sight I thought it was a desert.
In fact these are the badlands of Wyoming. The land here is
completely yellow and barren with very little vegetation. I did not
see such a desolate stretch of land again till I reached Nevada
desert. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Wyoming%20oil%20wells.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Many

</P>
<P LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3>After Worland, we reached Thermopolis -
my first sight of hotsprings. At the entrance at the town, there is a
huge banner painted on a side of a hill claiming &quot;The largest
hotsprings in the world&quot; with an arrow pointing to where the
hotsprings are.  Largest or not, it was very beautiful. The whole
place smelled of sulphur and I was to carry that smell in my nose
well after we left the place. Hotsprings are basically sources of hot
water from beneath the ground. Not very far under the ground are high
temperatures from which the water gets heated and comes out through
vents. There were quite a few pools of hot springs around the place
with vapors rising from them as if in a fairy tale. Where the water
flowed down the gradient, <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Thermopolis-coloured%20fungi%20in%20Hot%20Springs.jpg">different

depending upon the temperature of the water flowing there. It looked
like a deliberate <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Thermopolis-fungi%20formation.jpg">painting</A></U></FONT>
by an artist. Apparently, native Sioux Indians used to have annual
ritual baths at this place till the U.S. government bought the land
from their chief for a price of $60,000 in order to preserve the
springs. At the origin of <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Thermopolis-Hot%20Springs.jpg">one
of the springs</A></U></FONT>, I could see hot water emerging out of
the ground. The <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Thermopolis-steaming%20Hot%20Spring%20Lake.jpg">pool</A></U></FONT>
appeared bottomless with big leaf shaped dark green fungi growing
along its sides. Bubbles rose from beneath out of nowhere making
weird sounds. It was as if the hot waters were rising right out of
hell.  Totally cool. </FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Out of Thermopolis, we
drove into Wind River Canyon. Of course, Wind River winds through
this canyon. This is also supposed to be having Indian reservations.
I even thought I saw a teepee (Indian tent house). The drive took us
through three small tunnels.  The walls of the canyon were more
majestic than in Powder River Pass. At the end of the canyon, we came
across </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Thermopolis-reservoir%20at%20Wind%20River%20Canyon.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>a
huge man made reservoir.</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>  It was a
great unexpected view. As it began to rain, we headed on our way back
through the canyon towards Cody.  Cody lies right at the mouth of
Yellowstone National Park. We had a cabin booked at one of KOA
campgrounds (KOA = Kampgrounds of America). My first stay at a
campground.  Promptly became a KOA member for $10 as it meant I got
10% discount at any campground - it wasn't very long before I
recovered the membership fees with our repeated stays at campgrounds.
It was a neat campground and a comfortable wooden cabin with 4 beds,
two each bunkered on opposite walls of the cabin. After having bagels
and bread for dinner and planning our trip to Yellowstone the next
day, Pedro went off to sleep while I sat outside on the porch in a
cold night and logged my visits</FONT>.

shivering through the early morning chill but was glad that there was
a hot shower in there to warm up. The staff at the campground were
serving free pancakes that morning we obligingly showed up at the
right time to eat!  One recurring thing I noticed across all
campgrounds was that these were full of RV's or recreation vehicles.
In this country, when people retire, the grandpas and grandmas
peacefully rent a RV and take off on a trip across the country. These
RVs are huge vehicles resembling a
fully-equipped-mini-home-on-the-wheels with facilities to sleep, cook
and they even have restrooms (which get flushed out at dumpstations
that every campground has!). RVs are typically slow moving and god

finished, time to get started. We drove into Yellowstone from the
eastern entrance using Route 16. It turned out that this was the most
scenic route to enter the park. Yellowstone National Park was the
first national park in United States established in 1872. It covers
2.2 million acres and lies mainly in northwestern Wyoming, parts of
eastern Idaho and southern Montana. It’s like a strange heaven
isolated from the rest of the world. A fee of $10.00 at the entrance
allowed us to drive around the park for 7 days. That's peanuts for
this amazing<BR>place. Loops of roads have been constructed in the
shape of an &quot;8&quot; and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://YNP-entrance.jpg/"><FONT SIZE=3>we
entered</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3> from the eastern side of
the bottom half of the &quot;8&quot;....and our plan was to traverse
the entire stretch of 8 and get out through the southern entrance by
the end of the day into Grand Teton National Park.  That was too
ambitious a plan</FONT>. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Soon after entering, we
were on mountainous roads and driving amid thickly wooded </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="YNP-pine%20forests.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>dark
pine forests</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>. The first amazing
sight was that of snow capped peaks with small glaciers that are
sources of rivers in this park (I haven't been able to figure out
exactly which peaks these are)...okay, but this was my first sight of
a glacier, even if from quite some distance. Driving further, we
stopped by </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="YNP-Sylvan%20Lake.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Sylvan
Lake</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>...very clear and still water
with the pine trees around the banks and snow capped mountains
getting reflected in the water.  Pedro said the place reminded him of
Switzerland. This was just the beginning of a series of wonders we
were to see.  The pamphlets given to us at the gate warned about
approaching wildlife in the park. This place is supposed to have
grizzly bears, bison, elks, coyotes, deer, and what not. The park has
a daily newspaper, which talked about methods to protect oneself from
bear attacks. After scanning through the techniques, Pedro decided we
should buy a pepper spray, which can be used to spray on the bear and
confuse it while we make our getaway! It later turned out that the
spray costs $75 ... urghhh :)  Even the garbage cans everywhere are
specially designed to be bear proof. We didn't see any bears, but
lots of </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://YNP-bison.jpg/"><FONT SIZE=3>bison</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>
and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="YNP-Elks%20at%20Mammoth.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>some

</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Next the road took us by
the banks of the huge </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="YNP-Yellow%20Stone%20Lake.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Yellowstone
lake</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3> which covers a significant
portion of the park. Soon we came across small hot geysers. All along
the banks of the blue lake, steam rose up in the air through vents in
the ground. We stopped at many places and once I dipped my hand in
the lake's water to check the temperature.... ...aiiieee... the water
was cold, sorry no surprises here :) Close to some of the vents where
the steam rose, I felt the ground with my palm and that was much
warmer than normal. Later I learnt that this was a dangerous thing to
do since new vents are known to open up suddenly from ground and
bursting steam can cause burns. Anyway...cool experience! </FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Next stop was the
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="YNP-Fishing%20Bridge.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Fishing
Bridge</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>, which is situated where
water flows into Pelican Creek from the Yellowstone Lake. The
interesting fact about this bridge is that some strange fishes (I
forget the name) annually swim against the current and up the strong
rapids of the stream and mate at the mouth of the lake. Since fishes
are plenty in the mating season, many pelicans visit the area to feed
on them. As soon as this was noticed by our bright early adventurers,
they built a bridge across the mouth of the stream and hordes of
tourists flocked to this place to start fishing.  Soon the fishes got
scarce and the pelicans vanished too! These days fishing is not
permitted on the bridge but it is at many other places in the park if
you have a license. They call it a fishing bridge anyway. Apparently
pelicans did return after a gap of 60 years. Later we stopped by the
rapids downstream where the fishes are supposed to perform their
heroic jumps upstream. There weren't any jumping right then but it
was a nice place all the same. There was a very small hill near the
bridge and I was just contemplating about climbing up the hill to get
a better view of the lake when </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="YNP-%20bison%20at%20Fishing%20Bridge%20.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>a
bison appeared</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3> at the top. This
was a huge hairy beast that had apparently lost his way while grazing
merrily. It slowly climbed down the hill and upon suddenly
encountering so many people, got confused and started running across
the bridge. Soon the crowd around the bridge was all excited..., all
traffic on the bridge slowed down, some teenaged girls started
shouting in high frequency like mad for some strange reason, and
people pulled out their cameras and camcorders. Anyway, the poor
creature got all scared and ran across the bridge in the middle of
traffic and back into the forests. Some guy who didn't get to record
this encounter ran into the forest behind the bison with a camcorder
in his hand. Don't know if he actually came back out or became a
grizzly's lunch. :) Anyway, the bison gone, I climbed the hill, got
an unimpressive view and got myself `Patel` photographed against </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="YNP-you%20are%20in%20Bear%20Country.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>a

- that warned about recent bear sightings in that area. That was as
close as I ever got to a bear in the whole trip! </FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=3>Next we
stopped at Lake Village where we had coffee and I bought binoculars
which I was missing sorely while looking at grand views. Now onwards,
I had these two equipments - camera and binocs - almost permanently
hanging down my neck.  We drove further up north on the 8 loop. Next
stop was </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="YNP-mud%20volcano.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Mud
Volcanoes</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>. Again this region is a

below the ground at some places.  These </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="YNP-mud%20volcanos.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>mud
volcanoes</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3> keep bubbling with hot
water mixed in mud.  There are many caves here that resound with
heavy gurgling sounds of hot water in agitation.  At some places even
the parking lot had caved in with new fissures erupting all the time.
 Nearby was a Sulphur Cauldron which … well … smelled sulphur
really badly.   I really wanted to explore the extensive trails
further inside but, as Pedro rightly kept pointing out, we just
didn’t have enough time.  Anyway I resolved to be back sometime
later for a week’s trip and take every damn trail this place had to
offer.  Further down we got a view of a grassland along the slopes of
a hill with a big herd of bison peacefully grazing away and I got a
closer look at them with my binoculars.</FONT> 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>So we drove along to the
next stop, The </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="YNP-Grand%20Canyon.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Grand
Canyon of Yellowstone</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>.  From what
I gathered, this is where Grand Canyon extends right into
Yellowstone. Two falls, Upper and Lower,  lie at the head of the
canyon. It’s an amazing sight. We saw the canyon from multiple
locations, the Inspiration point, Grandview point and Lookout point.
The walls of the canyon are colored red blended with black - the
color being due to iron deposits. There's a steep 1600 feet descent
to the bottom where a small stream flows.  I used my newly acquired
binoculars extensively to view the different rock formations. The
Lookout point gives a great view of the Lower falls. Well...in a
sense then, I did after all visit the Grand Canyon! </FONT>

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=3>Now it was
getting close to evening and we had hardly covered a quarter of the

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Mammoth Hot Springs is a
small valley in the midst of a group of  tall ranges with, well, a

colored formations from various angles.  There were a group of inns
below in the valley with direct view of the mammoth springs. While
driving out of the place, I saw what I thought were statues of Elks
sitting and standing in the lawns of the inn. However these perfectly
still Elks started moving slowly as if coming back to life from
stone. It was camera time and I got some great pictures</FONT>.

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>It was now close to
twilight and we had to reach Moran campgrounds before night. We still
had not seen the most famous feature of Yellowstone - the geysers. So
we decided to head to the camp and return to Yellowstone the next day
again to see the geysers. It was a long drive. On the way I could see
perfectly heavenly scenes - streams flowing through creeks, serene
yellow grasslands contrasting the greenery behind, perfectly still
lakes where anglers stood still in knee deep water waiting for a
catch - as if blending into the stillness of the surroundings, views
of valleys down below with steam rising from earth into horizon. And
all the while I just wished we had more time. We ran into rain which
would suddenly stop when we were on the other side of a hill and
reappear when we came back. It soon grew dark and after some tense
driving through the rain on the narrow roads of the forests, we got
out of southern entrance of Yellowstone. After some more driving
through a no man's land with almost no direction signs on the road we
reached Moran campgrounds. Here we again took a wooden cabin and
after dinner of cold burritos, bread and cheese, went off to sleep.
Plan for next day....geysers of Yellowstone and Grand Teton National
Park</FONT>.

later in the day. We drove through the no man's land and could see
much more in daylight than we could driving the previous night. The
plan for the day was quite simple. Visit the geysers of Yellowstone,
get back to Grand Teton national Park, spend the day there and then
camp at Bear Lake. The most famous geyser in Yellowstone is the Old
Faithful geyser. It is so called since for ages it has been spewing
out huge bursts of water at an interval of more or less every 45
minutes to one hour. There are a bunch of other geysers around Old
Faithful that are not so faithful, but quite magnificent when they do
erupt. Back at the entrance of YellowStone, we asked the guard about
the timing of next eruption for Old Faithful. Surprisingly she didn't
know! Anyway, if we had to see it, we had to see it, no matter how
long the w</FONT>ait. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>After a long drive
through the forests of Yellowstone, we reached Old Faithful village. 
There are extensive walkways constructed around the geysers with </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="YNP-Old%20Faithful%20before%20eruption.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Old

center declared that OF was to erupt in ten minutes.  So Pedro and me
blended into the waiting crowd, everyone ready with his or her
cameras and camcorders.  The geyser itself is like a big boil on the
surface of earth with a cone at the center.  Steam rose from the cone
and water kept splashing out sporadically as the water pressure under
the ground steadily built up. Every time, a big splash occurred, the
crowd would get restless hoping this would be THE eruption.  When the
eruption did start, it was nothing like I have ever seen before. 
Huge volumes of hot water shot up to 30 feet from surface like an
enormous fountain. An amazing sight. The eruption lasted for almost
five minutes before dying down. Great pictures</FONT>. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3>Having paid our respects to the Old
Faithful, we moved on to other geysers. There were innumerable of
them. Some were small fissures in the ground. Some were big pools
with a small fountain-like spring in the center and a floor with sky
blue color. Some looked like cancerous wounds on the earth's surface.
One was shaped like an ear. The walkway passed so close to one of the
erupting geysers that water sprayed over me - not as hot as I
expected. There was a Grand Geyser, which erupted once in 12 hours.
Some erupted once in a few days. One was shaped like a castle and
showed considerable activity. Very interesting and unique place.  </FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=3>Happy at
having seen the most famous feature of Yellowstone, we moved on
towards Grand Teton. Grand Teton lies just south of Yellowstone. One
more journey southwards on the same path to get out of Yellowstone.
But this was more rewarding. The road going south on the western side
of 8 loop crosses the continental divide thrice. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Grand%20Teton-the%20Continental%20Divide.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Continental Divide</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3> is basically a
fault in earth's crust on American continent that runs from north to
south all across. As a result, streams originating on the eastern
side drain in the direction of the Atlantic Ocean whereas streams
originating on the western side drain towards the Pacific. We stopped
by one of these locations where there were actually two streams, one
draining in east and other in west. Absolutely cool effect! Again I
got myself `Patel` photographed against the signpost, pretending to
hold the divide together</FONT>.

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=3>The road
approaching Grand Teton provided an amazing frontal view of the
mountain ranges. Our ticket for Yellowstone was valid to Grand Teton
as well - a great deal for 10 bucks.  The national park is basically
a valley surrounded by the Teton mountain ranges that tower over its
background. Ages ago there was no valley, but after some major
earthquakes and shifts in tectonic plates, the surface caved in
creating what is now a beautiful valley. To reach the ranges, one has
to hike on extensive trails, something for which we didn't have much
time. All the same we decided to take a smaller trail besides </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Grand%20Teton%20NP-Jenny%20Lake.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Jenny
Lake</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3> which led to </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Grand%20Teton-the%20Hidden%20Falls.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Hidden
Falls</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>. To reach Jenny Lake, we had
to drive through the middle of the flat valley populated by tiny
shrubs and millions of crickets making their typical sound.  It was
great pulling out at some spots and getting to look at the towering
ranges on all sides. My binoculars found extensive use again in
exploring the nitty-gritty details of the glaciers that sat cosily
near the peaks</FONT>. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Near Jenny Lake, we
parked our car and started out on the trail. People returning on the
trail seemed flush and happy and every passer by wished a friendly
&quot;hi&quot; or &quot;hello&quot;.... something strange but
refreshing for me-straight-faced-New-Yorker.  There were many old
people who took the trail with enthusiasm.  Many families with 3 and
4 year olds in the group too.  </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Grand%20Teton%20NP-trail%20to%20Hidden%20Falls.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>It
was a long 3-mile trail</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3> through
thickly wooded forests that took us along the banks of Jenny Lake on
one side and steeply rising sides of the Teton ranges on the other
side. Initially I was in a rush to reach the falls as soon as
possible but soon realised that was not the way to enjoy a hike. So I
slowed down and took my time clicking photos of wild berries and
flowers and watching canoes and motorboats on the peaceful lake. 
Finally we heard the whooshing sounds of the falls. True to its name,
I couldn't see the falls even when the sound of water seemed to
surround the forest and streams flowed out from everywhere.    Only
after getting very close and from certain angle, I could see the
falls. It wasn't very impressive, perhaps because this wasn't the
season for excess water. We hiked back on the trail, more slowly than
before. Passed by a father with four toddlers having a tough time
convincing them to walk the rest of the trail. Lot of folks heading
towards the falls kept asking us how far it was...and so we walked on
till we reached the parking lot, had coffee watching the mountain
ranges and drove out. As the sun was setting behind the Teton ranges,
the whole valley was bathed in golden yellow with long shadows of the
ranges slowly creeping upon the valley. It was the most beautiful
sunset behind the mountains I have seen. Unfortunately I had
exhausted my stock of film rolls...so no pictures of this amazing
scene :( </FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Pedro meanwhile switched
on the FM channel on the radio to check if any stations reach this
remote place and surprisingly we could catch a few. One of the
popular songs was playing.  It’s a different kind of song in which
the lead guy &quot;speaks&quot; out light philosophical advice (very
similar to the TODAY'S GEMS from Srichie :) with music in the
background.  One of the advice he gave was &quot;Live in New York
some time in your life but leave before it makes you too hard.  Live
in Northern California sometime in your life, but leave before it
makes you too soft!&quot;....and here I was...bang...relocating
between exactly these very two places!  As we drove further, the
roads took us through one valley after another, each one more
beautiful than the other. Mountains surrounding the valleys were
yellow and the valleys themselves were covered with golden grasslands
or had farms with tiny hamlets sitting in the middle. Light from the
setting sun would fall at an angle from behind the mountains and
paint the valley with magical golden and orange hues. Amazing beauty.
 We passed through final miles of wilderness of Wyoming and covering
a small stretch of Idaho into Utah. It was night when we reach the
KOA kampgrounds at Garden City, which is by the banks of Bear
Lake</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Bear%20Lake%20-%20overview.jpg">Bear
Lake - overview.jpg</A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>. It was the Labor Day
weekend and the campground was packed with outdoor loving holiday
crowd with their RVs and water-sport gears. There were many high
school going kids working that night at the camp managing the
customers on their bikes and holding starwar-like green torchlights
in their hands.  We managed to rent one spot of ground just enough to
pitch Pedro's tent for the first time in the trip. Pedro unpacked his
camping gear. Since I had no prior experience setting up a tent, I
stood by showing the torch light while he unfolded the tiny package
and assembled it into a neat tent. Took many precautions to prevent
flies from getting into the tent. It was a cold night, close to 40
Farenhite. I slept soundly, tired from the day's 6-mile hike.  But
Pedro felt the chill and didn't sleep.  When we woke up in the
morning next day, there was a thin sheet of ice on the roof of the
car... ...but more about next day the next time - our journey through
the promised land of Mormons into The Salt Lake City</FONT>.

out of the tent just to have the cold chill hit my face. That really
woke me up. There was a thin sheet of ice on top of our car. Pedro
said it was too cold to sleep, whereas I had slept like a log.
Someone in a tent opposite to ours was still snoring heavily. Another
couple nearby were cooking their breakfast and endlessly washing
their vessels by a tap nearby (they were still doing that when we
left the site half an hour later). Rest of the camp was up and alive.
 All sites were packed with RVs and tents, kids running around in
tri-cycles, pets being let free in a small fenced yard for their
morning ablutions, and humans getting ready for their share of water
sports at Bear Lake. We got ready and headed away from Bear Lake
towards Salt Lake City</FONT>. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=3>The road
away from town climbed up a hill and at the top we got a magnificent
view of the clear blue Bear Lake. This was a long drive through Utah.
This part of the country has cities, towns and villages situated in
one valley after another. Roads mostly passed through valleys and
crossed a brief stretch of hills before entering another valley. Most
towns are really small, often with a population of a few hundred
people. One of them had a population of 17 (seventeen)! These towns
seemed to have been built around the highways and each would
typically last for a mile's stretch along the road. Each town had a
signboard declaring &quot;Historic Site&quot; with no other
description and pointing in some general direction into the town. We
started seeing these signs with such regularity that it became a game
for me and Pedro to locate towns that did not have a &quot;Historic
Site&quot;!  One of the towns had a tall monastery with two rising
pillars overlooking a scenic valley. We figured this must be a Mormon
temple. About 70% of the population of Utah belong to a special sect
of Christianity called Mormons.  In early 1800's, their religious
leader – Joseph Smith - got revelations when he was 14, organised a
band of followers in Ohio and moved to Jackson, Missouri which he
called Zion - some similarity to the Promised Land of Israel.  They
moved further to Illinois as they got persecuted by governments.
Later a section of the group split and were led by Brigham Young on a
difficult trip to the Great Salt Lake in Utah where he founded the
Salt Lake City.  So with much hope, we drove into </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Salt%20Lake%20City-train%20station.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Salt
Lake City</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>. The lake itself lies to
the northwest outskirts of the city. We decided to spend time in the
city instead. The whole city appeared deserted on the labor day
weekend. All shops were closed, only a few homeless people on the
streets - dead city. We parked our car and decided to walk around.
Just a week ago, a couple of blocks in the center of the city had
been hit by a tornado. I was hoping none would hit while we were
around! The city appeared to be a rich place by all appearances. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Salt%20Lake%20City-architecture.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Neat
clean streets, tall buildings</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3> with
fancy exteriors - just no one around. Only the homeless lying without
purpose on the streets belied its richness. It was like one of the
desolate cities they show in Star Trek in which Captain Kirk and his
crew try to find adventure</FONT>.

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>The main and perhaps the

dozing off under the sun in the lawns. More fancy buildings and empty
streets - actually it felt good walking through the deserted streets,
but I wouldn't want to live here.  Finally we located a Greek
restaurant in a street corner where the Chef told us that city was
like this every weekend. I ordered a Caisson while Pedro ordered a

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>It felt like we were

lunch, we headed towards the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Salt%20Lake%20City-The%20Mormon%20Temple.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Mormon
temple</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>. The temple has a grand
entrance and has neat interior compound. Visitors are not allowed
into the main temple but there are a few prayer halls around where
one can enter and even take pictures. There were many guides all too
eager to help with questions. One of them was taking visitors on a
guided tour and I joined the group in anticipation.  She took
everyone's introduction and then stood there silently and smiling
benignly waiting for something. I thought Pedro was getting restless
to move, so I left the tour for next time.  Getting out of the
temple, there were a group of teenage hippies with coloured hairdos
and rings sitting on the pavements. Suddenly one of the girls yelled
at me &quot;You know what? I hate this city. This city sucks!&quot; 
Dumbfounded at this unexpected outburst directed at
me-total-stranger, I decided to it was wiser to leave this claim
uncontested and moved on to a nearby Border's Bookstore where me and
Pedro had coffee. Following that, we drove out of Salt Lake City as
quickly as possible.  Again it was a long long drive through one
scenic valley of Utah after another. We camped in Pedro's tent at</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=3>Packed our tent for one last time in the trip today. 
Pedro and me had decided to ditch our plans for a grand finale at
Grand Canyon. Felt Pedro couldn't catch his flight from San Francisco
on 10th if we went there. Plus we had seen one too many canyons and
creeks on the way to be able to do justice to Mr. GC.  But hey, just
north of it and not that far was Las Vegas.  So we decided to make a
go for it tonight. It was a long distance from where we were. But
then LV's got to be seen by night or not at all. So let's go!  Our
first stop for the day was to be at Bryce Canyon situated in Dixie
National Forests. The vegetation along the drive was getting to be
much sparser and more shrub like, scattered over the hilly terrain of
Utah. Apparently northern Utah gets a lot of snow in winter. One of
the license plates on a Utah vehicle had declared &quot;The best snow
on earth!” Skiing must be a popular sport in this state. Anyway,
the weather this particular day didn't give any suggestion that this
land receives snow. We were on lower</FONT> <FONT SIZE=3>altitudes
and it was getting hot as ever.  Following directions to Bryce
canyon, we passed through a short stretch of plains and ...what did I
tell you? This land surprises you with sheer breathtaking contrasts.
Across the horizon, we could see a line of grey hills rising out of
ground and behind the grey hills, a stretch of completely red peaks
rose even higher. The only piece missing in the scene was a full
orchestra in the background as we approached the hills growing bigger
on us!  Ok..Enough hyperbole! We were at the entrance to Dixie
National Forests. The Red Peaks visible from afar belonged to the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="The%20Red%20Canyon.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Red
Canyon</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>, which extends for a couple
of miles from the entrance. Weird formations have formed on the
hillsides due to erosion over time. I immediately jumped out of car
and started taking pictures. The drive through the Red Canyon was
followed by more flat lands for next 20 miles before we reached Bryce
Canyon. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Bryce%20Canyon1.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Bryce
Canyon</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3> is situated in a land where
water is scarce. But the snow in winter seeps in as water into cracks
in rocks. There is a wide variation in temperature here during an
average day. As a result, the rocks break down over time and the
canyon keeps widening and churning out completely weird formations.
Apparently the best time to view the canyon is at sunrise or at
sunset when the light plays tricks with eyes creating brilliant
illusions of colors on these</FONT> <FONT SIZE=3>red rocks. Dah! We
were here in the afternoon in searing heat and there was nothing that
could be done about that.  But guess what? </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Bryce%20Canyon-a%20great%20photograph.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>The
best pictures I took in the whole trip came from the Bryce Canyon</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>!
The afternoon sky was clear blue and contrasted perfectly against the
red walls of the</FONT> <FONT SIZE=3>canyon. We decided to take </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Bryce%20Canyon-hiking%20through.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>a
three-mile trek through the canyon</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>.
Starting off from Sunrise point, we climbed down the slopes. Grand
view of a group of rock formations that looked like carefully placed
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Bryce%20Canyon-pieces%20on%20a%20chess%20board.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>pieces
on a chessboard</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>. There were
natural holes punched on the sides of the canyon that looked like
bridges. The bottom of the canyon had trails of a dry stream. The end
of the trek at Sunset point was an extremely steep climb 850 feet up
the sides of canyon for more breathtaking views.  With time only to
cover this fraction of the portion of Bryce, we drove out, back
through the Red Canyon and towards Zion National Park. </FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Zion is another natural
wonder. At the entrance to the Zion, there are a set of hills. It’s
as if each is made out of single rock and someone has carefully
placed very very regular deep rectangular stripes across all its
sides - most strange hill I have ever seen. Its called Checkerboard
Mesa.  Drive further into Zion took us through a series of tunnels
with high rocky hills on all sides.  The longest of the tunnels was 2
Kms long.  (And yes! for some strange reason, they started using the
metric system here to mark the distances. Only place in U.S. so far
where I have seen metric system being used.)   It was a single lane
one-way traffic in the tunnel with the traffic in one direction being
stopped till a group of vehicles from the other direction cleared
through. The Zion Canyon is somewhat ensconced and hidden away in the
middle of the forests.  It must have taken considerable persistence
on part of the early adventurers to reach here.  Beyond the tunnels
began our descent to the base of the canyon. The narrow road going
down had frequent hairpin bends. Halfway down, I could see strange
big arches cut into the rocky walls of the canyon - like someone's
great throne</FONT>. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>At the bottom, the road
follows the Virgin River in a long scenic drive. This Monday being a
Labor Day holiday, there was considerable crowd and as a result, lot
of vehicular traffic. Cars were parked at all possible nook and
corners along the road and I wondered if this was more like a picnic
area than a protected national forest. With so many man-made
constructions that I saw along the canyons bottom, I just had to
conjure up images in my mind of how the place would have looked like
before man stepped in here.  Our first stop was at the head of a
trail, which went up half a mile along the canyon's walls to a place
called Weeping Rocks.  This is a great arch on the walls on the
canyon with water from some small stream dripping down slowly along
its edges. All kinds of strange creepers, fungi and plants grow
besides on the walls so that they are called the Hanging Gardens. We
could actually walk under the dripping water and into the shade of
the arch to observe the place. The place was pretty slippery, still a
bunch of toddlers and kids were jumping around in water and slush
having a great time. One of the parents told his 5-year- old girl not
to get wet by going under the falling water. The girl promptly
proceeded to get drenched under the tiny waterfall and called after
her father &quot;Dad! Why don't you come in too? It’s real fun!&quot;
</FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Next we drove further to
the tip of canyon - a place called &quot;The Temple of Sinawava&quot;.
It’s a semi-circular area surrounded by high rocky walls with small
streams flowing in from around to join the Virgin River.  The place
was absolutely packed with cars with no parking space and people
having picnic all around the stream. We couldn't get a parking spot
there and decided to head back through the canyon. Halfway through,
we stopped to take a 2-mile trail to a set of three pools called the
&quot;Emrald Pools&quot; - the upper, middle and lower pools. I
proceeded ahead alone as Pedro went searching for something at a
nearby lodge and said he would follow me. The trek took me along the
rim of the canyon and provided great overlooks of the rocky faces of
the canyon from various points. Pedro caught up with me pretty soon.
We visited the middle and the lower pools. One had to trek 3 miles
further to reach the upper pool and there was no time for that. I
would rather call them &quot;puddles&quot; of water since there is
little water flowing along the streams at this time of the year</FONT>.
 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>But the trek peaceful. 
Back at the bottom of the canyon, we had coffee at a lodge while
looking from the windows at a magnificent view of a towering red rock
face of the canyon in front.  It was getting close to evening now and
our aim was to reach Las Vegas by night if we were to get to see its
famed nightlife. We wanted to book a room in advance of getting
there. There were at least a thousand rooms in each of the big lodges
or hotels listed in the tourbook. We finally located a hotel that
suited our budget. Apparently it also doubled up as a casino, but it
was supposed to be one of the lesser mortals in the city of the rich
and mighty.  So from the bottom of a deep canyon in the middle of a
nowhere forest in Utah, I dialled a number 150 miles away in a desert
city called Las Vegas and booked our rendezvous for the night!</FONT>
 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>We drove out of the Zion
Canyon and took the nearest interstate freeway # 15 heading towards
LV. After crossing the Utah border, we drove through a brief 30-mile
stretch of Arizona. The landscape now consisted of absolutely barren
grey hillsides.  For a stretch, we had to drive westwards and the
glare from the setting sun would blind us from the front. I had a
hard time keeping my car in the lane. The speed limit here was 75
miles per hour and people easily drove at 90 or 100. For our loaded
Hyundai driving on a hilly road, even 65 is a great feat!  The
traffic was pretty heavy. There were signs, which warned that these
highways were patrolled by aircraft. Apparently the cops just take
note down the registration number of speedsters from up in the sky
and mail a ticket to your home address..nice, you get roasted and you
don't even realise...at least till later :</FONT>)

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Once we entered Nevada,
the landscape became more valley-like with barren hills on the
horizon. We drove through miles of desert having just small bushes
and shrubs for vegetation.  At one point, we realized we were low on
gas and needed to refuel.  I was warned that in Nevada, you could
drive for a couple of hundred miles without encountering any sign of
habitation, let alone gas stations.  Alarmed, we took the next exit,
which showed gas with an arrow pointing into nowhere in the forsaken
desert.  Many miles into the exit and we still couldn't trace even
the faintest sign of any town or village.  After about five miles, we
reached a small town by the side of a small pond in the middle of the
desert.  Gas prices were, of course, sky-high.  While refuelling, got
to peacefully watch a beautiful sunset over the desert skyline. Small
reward for long detour!  Drove back five miles back on the highway
towards LV.  </FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>By the time we reached
the outskirts of Las Vegas, it was night. In order to get into the
Vegas mood, we decided to tune into the local FM stations. 
Immediately I was hearing the sounds of Frank Sinatra filtering into
car. Sinatra is apparently a legend in this city, which breathes his
music every day. Ironically, one of his numbers, which I heard
repeatedly here, was &quot;New York! New York!&quot; :)  As the
highway entered the city from over the hills, down beneath in the
valley, in the center of a desolate desert, there were a million
glittering golden lights of the city.  It was an amazing and crazy
sight. It required an extremely high level ingenuity and insanity for
someone to land up in the middle of nowhere in a desert and decide to
erect the biggest and most famous gambling city in the world with its
two hundred thousand inhabitants making a living out of this
business</FONT>.  
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>As crazy and fantastic
as it appeared from a distance, it appeared more insane as we drove
into it. My first impression of the city was that of a clown with a
perpetually smiling facemask to entertain his daily train of
customers. There was glitter and pomp everywhere. Every neon sign was
for some casino, hotel, motel, free buffets, million dollar gambling
prizes and what not. Every inch of the exterior of entire buildings
were illuminated with bright colored lights to attract maximum
attention. Even grocery stores and gas stations had slot machines
lines up so that people could try their luck anytime, anywhere.  We
checked into our hotel (which had a decent number of slot machines
lined up from the entrance to the dining cafe). </FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><BR><FONT SIZE=3>It was a pretty good
room for a cheap price.  The food and lodging in this city are
supposed to be cheap so that people can spend more money gambling. 
Freshened up with a hot shower and had dinner at a nearby Indian
restaurant called &quot;Gandhi Restaurant&quot; - poor Gandhiji
turning in his grave. Finally we walked </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Las%20Vegas%20streets.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>onto
the streets</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3> to have a taste of Las
Vegas.  Many `Noveau riche` of the city drove around on the four-lane
city roads in flashy convertibles, classy limousines and loud
motorbikes.  Every third car had loud music on its stereo, mad look
in the its driver's eyes, and speed in its wheels.  A merry and
happily drunk couple was swaying on the sidewalk.  The crowd knew how
to dress for the night. Men young and old, in formal suits, gelled
hairs, cigars in mouth and stern straight look in eyes. Women, young
and old, in flashy dresses, high heels, fat purses. And, just like in
any other big city of U.S., there was other part of the crowd too -
homeless people in rags, mostly blacks and Hispanics, hanging around
street corners, accosting passers-by for small change, handing out
advertisement pamphlets or just lost in the world. Towering over this
melting pot of people were the tall flashy glittering multi-storeyed
casinos. Ballagio was a casino with a sprawling garden</FONT>.

Different areas in this five-star casino were designed to give the
effect of walking through the open streets of Rome and were called by
 Roman names.  The amount of money they put in to maintain this world
of make believe is amazing. Paris was a casino built in the shape of
Eiffel Tower. The interiors resembled the streets of Paris. The
ceiling was so painted and lighted to give the impression that we
were walking under open skies. The employees and even the customers
wore typical French dresses. Young women looking like French models
sat along the benches of this make believe streets with cigars in
their mouth and exuding typical cool looks of the French. Another
casino was called New York. It had </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Las%20Vegas-two%20big%20casinos.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>two
buildings</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>, one resembling the

 </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Las%20Vegas-casinos.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>There
were bridges with conveyer belts connecting different casinos</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>
to each other. This way people could move around between casinos
easily and the owners of casinos happily shared the money these
customers had to offer.  The main playing area looked the same at all
casinos. Young and rich men with their women sat at table games and
played high stakes   Old retired people sat alone at slot machines,
spending away their life's savings quarter by quarter.  The
continuous music emanating from slot machines filled the background
and sounded like incantations for money.  The night shows in Las
Vegas are another famous feature.  We checked the prices but it was
more expensive than we thought and we decided against it.  What's
visiting Las Vegas without a little gambling.  So I played exactly a
dollar at one of the slot machines. Each of the four quarters
dutifully vanished into the machine like a black hole! It had been a
long day and we stumbled back to our hotel room for a good night's
rest</FONT>.

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Left Las Vegas in the
morning and drove into </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Mojave%20Desert.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Mojave
Desert</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>. Our aim was to cross the
width of California and hit the West Coast. This was going to be the
toughest test for my car thus far. We packed a lot of water, filled
the gas tank to the brim and headed west out into the desert's
wilderness. The desert stretch was more tiring than any other. It was
a hot day, but we decided to use the air-conditioner sparingly in
order to save on gas. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Mojave%20Desert%20highway.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>The
highway</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3> went in a straight line
for miles and miles through the middle of the desert. At times we saw
mirages of water far away. The land was more of hard barren brown
stretch of flat ground with sparse shrubby vegetation than sand.  It
was afternoon when we hit the first town, Barstow, after a few of
hours of driving. Filled car's gas tank and stocked more water again
as a precautionary measure and as we headed out of Barstow, we drove
on the historic Route 66 for a short stretch. Now don't ask me what's
historic about it ... the only reason I knew about this route is
because there is a brand of Jeans that carries the name &quot;Route
66&quot;! I guess this must have been one of the early routes to the
West</FONT> <FONT SIZE=3>Coast.  On the way, we passed through a
customs checkpost.  This is where Californian authorities check
passing vehicles for agricultural materials.  Apparently they are
extremely paranoid about genetic materials from outside entering the
state. We were just waved off to pass on. Had we been checked, it
would have revealed a small pack of apples and pears. I honestly
could not understand how they could enforce such a regulation in a
foolproof manner</FONT>.

</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Next we set out to cross
the remaining stretch of Mojave. We passed by the Edwards Air Force
Base, which sprawls over a rectangular stretch of desert.  We passed
by many air force and army vehicles on the road. I pulled out my
binoculars to peep at the various military structures just in case I
got to see something interesting.  Finally I could locate a line of
what looked like transport aircraft.  We approached Mojave town,
which had a stretch of barren hills in the background.  The hillsides
were dotted with hundreds of windmills.  I have never seen so many
windmills in one place.   Presumably they supplied power to the air
force base and  Mojave  Township  down below in the valley. At Mojave
town we turned south on a road that led directly to Los Angeles City.
Sixty miles north of LA, we headed west again into Antelope Valley. 
Slowly life and vegetation began to show signs again.  A canal with
crystal clear blue water was being used to cultivate the hillsides</FONT>.

</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally we hit the Coast
Range of Californian Mountains.  It was my first taste of Californian
life when we stopped at a Mac Donald’s in Gorman for a late lunch. 
People appeared more relaxed and friendlier than where we were coming
from.  It was definitely sunnier than where we were coming from.
Southern accent - definitely more twisted than where we were coming
from.  Its &quot;all rightie!&quot;, not a straight &quot;all right&quot;.
 (I later found that even my friend from India who had arrived here
not very long ago had caught on to this expression!).  As my English
professor at Stony Brook had pointed out, it promised to be a
different country altogether.  All rightie ... here we come CA!  We
decided to drive in through Los Padres National Forest. It was miles
of scenic and also some of the most difficult mountain driving thus
far. We stopped at a point called Valley Vista , which provided view
of a brown hill below with ridges spread into neighboring valley like
fingers of a gigantic human palm.  Mountainsides were covered with
yellow grasslands with cows grazing peacefully.  Amazingly there were
lots of private properties within the national forest. We lost our
way very soon on these unmarked roads and kept guessing our exact
position in the map. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Los%20Padre's%20NP%20-%20sunset.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>When
it approached sunset</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>, we were
still entering and exiting Los Padres repeatedly and I began
wondering if I would get the sight of the Pacific Ocean by the night</FONT>.
 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Fortunately we came back
on the tracks and at dusk we reached Ojai (pronounced Ohai... you get
the idea..here &quot;j&quot;'s don’t have an identity of their own
:).  We stopped for a coffee.  More &quot;all righties&quot; at the
shop counter.  It seemed to be a small rich town.  People here seemed
to be fitness freaks. Young boys and girls were out for their evening
jog while the older lots were having brisk walks.  We decide to park
at Santa Barbara for the night - the site of the all too famous TV
soap show by the same name from which I used to shrink back in
disgust while my sister watched it religiously everyday!  But I was
quite eager to see what this town was all about after all. Pedro, who
had been there before, promised it was something to see.  So we
headed on route 101 along the coastline and I got the first sight of
the Pacific Ocean in my life.  As we approached Santa Barbara, the
sun had already set in the horizon and had left a reddish tinge
across the skyline. All places marked on the highway had Spanish
names and Pedro appeared to be quite happy in the familiar
surroundings.  Whenever I came across a Spanish name he would gladly
translate its meaning to me.  Thus I learnt that Santa Barbara and
San Francisco were actually names of early missionary saints in this
region</FONT>.  
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>The first thing I
noticed in Santa Barbara were the palm trees along the roads.  There
were hardly any multi-storeyed buildings. Most buildings were built
with </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Santa%20Barbara-Spanish%20style%20buildings.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Spanish
architecture</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3> - which got duly
identified courtesy Pedro's expertise - and were painted with
creamish color.  After a bit of hunting around the town, we located
an international youth hostel called &quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Santa%20Barbara-Banana%20Bunglow.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Banana
Bungalow</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;.  It was a kind of
yuppie place run by a German guy who said he had travelled all over
the world before deciding that Santa Barbara was the place to live
in.  The accommodation was cheap at $20 a person per night.  It was a
small two storeyed regular house which had fancy painting all over it
and had been torn up and redesigned inside to give an appearance of
chaos which a typical college student loves to live in.  The place
was more of a dorm with bunkered beds - eight in our small room. 
There was internet access in what was once a living room  and had 
now been fitted  with more  beds.  There  were  shared cooking 
facilities  where a group  of students was busy cutting vegetables.  
Pedro and me dumped our luggage, had dinner at a Subway, and headed
into the town</FONT>.  
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Our first stop was the
pier along the ocean - a wooden platform that jutted into the sea. 
It was a nice hangout place with restaurants and bars.  I was
surprised to see that cars could drive onto the pier and there was a
reasonably big parking lot on it.  Next we walked through the
downtown of Santa Barbara.  Pedro was especially happy since the
whole town had Spanish culture imprinted everywhere.  Most streets
have Spanish names.  Pedro was quick to point out the few buildings
that did not conform strictly to Spanish architecture.  The State
Street was the hub of nightlife. There were pubs dotting every block
where youngsters hung out having a good time dancing and drinking.
Someone sat on the sidewalk playing a pathetic tune on his guitar.  A
number of homeless people hung around in corners even here. </FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>We woke up early morning
on Wednesday and had </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Santa%20Barbara-%20back%20streets.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>a
walk through the town</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3> in daylight.
Santa Barbara waking up to the morning was much different than at
night. It was somewhat of a foggy morning at sea. Someone was
carefully cleaning last night's stains and dirt from the cream
colored walls of the buildings. It appeared to be a toy town kept in
perfect shape. Number of snack shops opened up with breakfast and
coffee. We walked through the town and went to a Catholic mission
church , which was one of the earliest in this place.  It was a big
stone structure that had once been destroyed in an earthquake and
then rebuilt.  The church inside was ornate and quiet - a lone woman
kneeling down and praying.   After seeing the garden in their
courtyard we headed back towards the sea.  The shore had many bikers,
skateboarders and early morning joggers.  After spending some time on
the beach, we headed out of Santa Barbara in our last leg of the
journey towards our final destination - San Francisco! <BR></FONT><BR>

</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Out from Santa Barbara,
we drove north on route 101 along the shoreline. We passed through a
lot of farms - stretches of flat green cultivated land which
resembled the rice fields of South India.  Most of the farm workers
were Hispanics and had a rustic look , which was quite different from
any people I had seen in other parts of this country. After passing
by Santa Maria, we stopped at Pismo Beach along the rocky shoreline
and had our lunch while watching a group of wave surfers.  This was
the first time I was seeing anyone wave surfing.  It’s a curious
ritual to watch.  The surfer would patiently lie flat on his
surfboard for something like 10 to 15 minutes turned towards the sea
and waiting for the ideal wave. When the surf came, he would turn
right around, ride the crest of the wave and when it just began to
break, he would deftly stand up on his board and slide along the
breaking sides of the wave till he tumbled down with the crashing
water. Hmm...so many things to learn</FONT>.  
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>We left the surfers to
their sport and moved further north through San Louis Obispo to join
US route 1 of California. This narrow </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Drive%20en%20route%20San%20Francisco.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>route
runs right along the Californian coastline</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>
with </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Californian%20Coastal%20Ranges.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>mountain
peaks</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3> on one side and the
hillsides dropping steeply into the sea on the other side.  Along the
ridges, where the hills met sea, there were many small beaches.  
Some were private, while others looked like they had never been
stepped upon.  Fog rose from sea level, travelled along the
hillsides, up the mountaintop and merged into the clouds.  The road
twisted and turned along the rim of the mountains all the way.  Since
the road was so narrow, one could either drive or look, but not both
at the same time.  One mistake and you drive down the slopes to one
of the beaches down below, where you basically have to sunbathe till
a chopper comes along to pick you up and put you back on the road up
above!  Just kidding...driving wasn't that bad but was reasonably
challenging.  We stopped by at many turnouts and took pictures</FONT>.
 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>There were private
properties at weird locations along the hillsides.  One of the houses
was constructed on a wooden plank jutting out of the slopes onto the
sea. The driveway from the highway to the house was a steep drop
along the incline.  Nearing Monterey, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Thunderstorm%20riding%20along%20with%20us%20on%20the%20sea.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>we

lightning flashes went all the way to the surface of water. I hoped
that the storm wouldn't cross our way till Sunnyvale, which, by the
way, was where we were planning to camp for the night at the house of
my friend V. Narasimha Rao (VNR as everyone calls him).  On the way,
we got a view of Hearst Castle perched on the top of a hill. It
looked like one of the old castles of England; Pedro told me that
some millionaire built it by the same name who didn't know what
better thing to do with the money he had.  Apparently it’s supposed
to be a spooky place and there are trips from the bottom of the hills
that take visitors through the castle.  We didn't have much time
today to share with the ghosts that inhabited this place and after
promising them we'll come back later to scare their wits out, we
moved on.  </FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Drove further up north
into </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="Santa%20Cruz-mystery%20spot.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Santa
Cruz</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>. This was a small town, which
looked like a slightly run down middle class town, not as well off as
Santa Barbara, and mostly inhabited by Hispanics.  We tried to locate
the downtown.  Signs were really confusing and pointed towards
downtown in all directions.  Finally we found ourselves by the
seashore which had a pier, a beach with folks playing volleyball,
some restaurants and a fake casino where people didn't play with real
money.  Quite a peaceful place on a cloudy evening except for a
little while when all seagulls started screaming their throats out
for reasons only they knew.  Finding out way out through the maze of
signs in Santa</FONT> <FONT SIZE=3>Cruz, we headed towards Sunnyvale
to VNR's house.  A bunch of towns around San Jose - Sunnyvale, Palo
Alto, Cupertino, Mountain View, Redwood, Milpitas and Fremont - along
with Stanford University comprise the famed Silicon Valley. As we
entered the Silicon Valley, there was a tangible change in
surroundings.   The ads on the radio started chirping about
anything-and-everything-dot-com with each one offering some or the
other form of internet service.  Offices along the way belonged to
some software company or the other.  Silicon was in the air. All
signs indicated this placed belonged to the hi-tech minded. 
Sunnyvale seemed to teeming with Indian and Chinese software
professionals</FONT>.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <BR><FONT SIZE=3>I
could see more Indians and Chinese around than Americans. But for the
Spanish and English names of the streets, one can easily mistake this
for another country. This was a spacious locality.  Even the side
streets were three lanes wide!  Something unimaginable around New
York area.  Following the directions I had got from VNR, we located
VNR's house. VNR was my ex-colleague at Wipro Infotech in Bangalore
and like every other Indian software professional, he is here making
his customary pilgrimage to the Silicon Valley working with Veritas.
But unlike most others, he steadfastly refuses to apply for a green
card and wants to go back to India.  We were meeting after two years
and after introducing Pedro, and reminiscing about old times and
catching up on who is where, we headed out for dinner. Another friend
of VNR, again ...you guessed it...a software professional from India
who was new to U.S., joined us and we went to ...you guessed it...an
Indian restaurant :)  Pedro was used to Indian cuisine by now -
courtesy Stony Brook's Curry Club - and promptly looked for Saag in
the menu. After dinner, we went home and I dozed off like a log. Next
morning VNR left early for office.  We packed up and left for
Richmond which is where my future apartment was located</FONT>.

Ships use this route to enter the bay from Pacific to ports in
Oakland and Richmond.  On turning my back to the bridge, I could see
scenic ridged hillsides dropping into the Pacific Ocean.  The fog
from the sea was just about to move into the bay, so we were lucky to
get a clear view.  I have visited this location many times over since
then and each time I get to see a different sight of the bridge with
the backdrop of the city.  We drove over the bridge, into San
Francisco. Our first stop was at </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="San%20Francisco-Marina.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Marina</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>
by the seashore.  We stopped at Round Table Pizza for lunch and for
the first time I played music from a juke box in the restaurant while
we waited for the pizza. This part of the city was very relaxed. We
parked out car near the pizza shop and walked up the streets.

along the Marina had very uniform architecture - three to four
storeys high, mostly painted white with ornate windows protruding
from semi-hexagonal corners</FONT>.

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Our next stop was at the
most famous street of San Francisco - the Crooked Street (real name
Lombard Street). Its a hard bricked red street and is called crooked
because it starts from the top of a small hill, called </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="San%20Francisco-Russian%20Hill.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Russian
Hill</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>, and winds down steeply like
a snake.  The sides of the road are planted with small rose gardens
and there are residential houses built in typical San Francisco style
on both sides.  People who visit this street in their car drive from
the top of the hill to the bottom.  Others, like us, who use their
feet, walk along the side of the road to the bottom of the hill and
have their pictures taken against the background of the curving road.
Its like an unending ritual that repeats thousand times a day with
every visitor who comes here.  Nearby down the hill was </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="San%20Francisco-fishermen's%20wharf.jpg"><FONT SIZE=3>Fisherman's
wharf</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3> - an colourful street by the
seaside with lots of places to eat, traffic mingling freely with the
crowd on the street, and many guys performing tricks in the middle of
the street to make their living.  Thus we wrapped up our tour to San
Francisco</FONT>.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>I planned to go to VNR's
place for the night and on the way dropped Pedro at San Francisco
airport.  He had to now fly back to Portugal through New York and his
flight was at night.  Pedro had been an ideal travel partner and a
great company throughout the trip. But for him, it would have been
impossible for me to make this trip of a lifetime. He had experience
travelling all over Europe and that proved to be invaluable.  Always
planning the trip to the last details, our next stops, estimated
times, and providing me with excellent driving tips.  Most important
of all, he knew how to find most interesting spots in new places - so
essential to having fun in the trip. Hats off to a great guy with
great pluck!  We bid our goodbye and I drove down to VNR's house
where I stayed awake late into night reading my e-mails on the net
and waking up VNR frequently with repeated sounds of the modem
resetting.  This was my first touch of a computer keyboard in a
fortnight - a fortnight away from the virtual world of bits and bytes
and in the real world as it is</FONT>.

      <h2>South Dakota : Fossils, Presidents and Gambling</h2>
      Wed. 1st Sept.
      <BR>-------------
      <P>Woke up to a great morning at Chamberlain in South Dakota along the
      banks of Missouri. I got up early,
      <BR>got ready, and had coffee along the river banks. On the other side
      of the river Chamberlain town was
      <BR>enveloped in mist that hung halfway through a bridge across the river.
      Went for a walk alone to shoot some
      <BR>photos of Missouri waking up lazily to sunrise. I wasn't disappointed
      with what I got to capture
      <BR>in my films. I went back to the hotel room for a quite breakfast while
      Pedro scoured the beautiful
      <BR>river banks for some more time.
      <P>Soon we were driving westwards again on interstate 90 towards Badlands.
      This stretch of South Dakota is
      <BR>again basically lots of farms and grasslands. And we kept driving along
      the monotonous terrain, I began
      <BR>wondering whether the famed beauty of South Dakota was overhype. But
      one thing I learnt on this
      <BR>trip is never to underestimate the power of this land to shake you
      out of slumber with the power of
      <BR>magnificent contrasts and surprises. I came upon the contrast I wouldn't
      forget in a hurry. Amid miles
      <BR>of grasslands and farms, a group of naked cliffs jutt into sky to present
      an amazing contrast. These
      <BR>are the Badlands, very strange looking bunch of mountains having veins
      along the sides created by ages
      <BR>of erosion.
      <P>The native Indians and later the French independently named it as Badlands
      since they
      <BR>couldn't use the land for any purpose. Later this place was found to
      be rich in dinausaur and other
      <BR>ancient fossils and became a protected region. This terrain very much
      resembles the Chambal Valley in India,
      <BR>probably only more colorful. Our first sight was a splendid overview
      of the Badlands from the periphery.
      <BR>Soil erosion has caused the volcanic sediments to erode over half a
      million years and exposed various layers
      <BR>of soil along the sides of the hills - red, yellow, maroon, brown,
      violet (!). Great place for photography.
      <BR>A thin stretch of well maintained roads took us on a loop around and
      into Badlands with many places
      <BR>to stop for scenic overlooks. There were many hiking trails going into
      the heart of the hills and I
      <BR>wished I could stay longer and go along one of these - but I was just
      passing by this place - couldn't
      <BR>afford to stay longer!
      <P>We left badlands towards Rapid City. Badlands followed us a long way
      and and slowly faded
      <BR>into grasslands. We drove into Rapid City around 3:00 p.m. and pedro
      quickly located its downtown
      <BR>with his action sensing radars. This place seemed to have less population
      than Sioux Falls city but
      <BR>had more activity and liveliness. This place had lots of shops and
      streets with German sounding
      <BR>names but I coudn't figure out if it had any German historical influence.
      <BR>Lots of students seemed to be walking around in streets, many with
      painting canvasses and
      <BR>musical instruments. We entered a small restaurant and ordered Cafe
      Mocha
      <BR>and sat observing the strange place. The restaurant was a bright place
      with had lots of modernist
      <BR>paintings hanging on the walls. A shelf in the corner had a bunch of
      books on phiolosophy and art.
      <BR>On one side were a bunch of computers with somebody tring to set up
      network connection among them.
      <BR>A student sat in a table in front of us reading seriously. Someone
      upstairs was practicing
      <BR>loud guitar, again nd again going over the same tune trying to get
      it right. There were a bunch of
      <BR>CDs on sale with songs from some local band. A group of teens entered
      the place who seemed very
      <BR>friendly and happy - they seemed to know everyone around the restaurant
      ... this seemed like a local
      <BR>hangout for these kids more than a restaurant. A happy place that felt
      good and which somehow stood
      <BR>out in my memory of the whole trip.
      <P>We left Rapid City and entered Black Hills nearby where there's Mount
      Rushmore with the faces
      <BR>of four presidents carved out on a steep rock cliff. It was close to
      evening&nbsp; and Black hills
      <BR>looked really black - they are thickly wooded with dark green pine
      trees. We encountered
      <BR>steep curvy mountain roads for the first time in the trip and this
      was the beginning of a long
      <BR>mountain drivong test that my car was to survive through for the rest
      of the trip. We reached
      <BR>Mount Rushmore and had a look at the faces of presidents from various
      vantage points. It seemed
      <BR>like such a crazy idea to carve out faces of presidents on a rock cliff
      in a virtually
      <BR>no-man's land. Apparently this was a big national project at the time
      it was done and
      <BR>Saouth Dakota's official slogan now read "Great Places, Great Faces!".
      There was even a mini
      <BR>demonstration by a guide that explained how the faces were sculpted
      on the rock face.
      <BR>It began raining and we decided to head out of the place. First drive
      through rain
      <BR>in our journey. Black Hills are a great place to drive through. We
      stopped at scenic Potoma
      <BR>Reservoir that fed water to Rapid City and surroundings.
      <P>Our next stop was Deadwood. A small township, but very strange place.
      Situated in the middle of
      <BR>Black Hills, it is more of a tourist township with a thriving Casino
      business. It started
      <BR>out as a gold mining township and soon gambling became the favorite
      pastime for the folks. They
      <BR>have legends all over the town about different great gamblers who inhabited
      the town and
      <BR>their famous stories. There was a monument for one such guy who, the
      stone claimed,
      <BR>was shot to death by some other gambler. The night life in the town
      was just picking up
      <BR>when we arrived there. Many casinos had flashy cars outside as rewards
      for winning a jackpot.
      <BR>Many old men and women dressed fashionably roamed around and seemed
      to be having a good time
      <BR>at these places.
      <P>Driving out of Deadwood and onto the interstate, I felt a strange feeling
      - like I was Alice
      <BR>in Wonderland - jumping into one rabbit hole after another with a different
      fairyland
      <BR>in each hole, a different experience. I was entering one strange place
      after another, each a
      <BR>completely unique emotional experience and quickly getting out of it,
      all packed into
      <BR>such a short period of time. Felt like I was looking at all this from
      way up above in the sky,
      <BR>and it seemed such a strange world to have such different things packed
      in a small place
      <BR>called Earth! Interstates roads seemed like the only a long, lonely
      and sane places on this planet.
      <P>We drove into Spear Fish where we had a room booked and rested for the
      night.

      <h2>Cowboy Towns : Something for you to remember us by!</h2>
      Here's the account my drive across Minnesotta. A day in which
      <BR>I didn't see any big places, but had a lot of fun anyway.

      <P>Tuesday 31st Aug
      <BR>----------------
      <BR>Woke up at La Crosse and left the motel after breakfast.
      <BR>We picked up some more eatables form a local grocery store
      <BR>where the people were more friendly than I had seen
      <BR>so far in the trip. We roamed around a sleepy towship which
      <BR>wasn't up even at 10:00 a.m.&nbsp; We went to the banks of
      <BR>junction where three rivers -Mississippi, Black, and La Crosse -
      <BR>meet each other. There was a huge statue of Hawaiatha
      <BR>native Indian by the river. So I stood in front of
      <BR>the statue and Pedro took a snap of an alien Indian standing
      <BR>in front of a native Indian! Also went through a small
      <BR>museum which had the history of La Crosse. Apparently the
      <BR>French were the first from Europe to arrive in the area
      <BR>and they set up lots of lumber businesses around the place.
      <BR>Mississippi river served as a means of transporting the timber
      <BR>to downstream locations.
      <P>We drove out of La Crosse and into Minnesotta. The number plates
      <BR>on the car ahead of us declared "Minnesotta - a land of 10000 lakes".
      <BR>Indeed we saw many lakes along the places we passed by. Northern part
      <BR>of the state is supposed to be more scenic and from the maps
      <BR>it appeared to have more lakes. But we were driving along the
      <BR>southern border of Minnesotta and this region was mostly
      <BR>great plains and prairies. It was miles and miles of farmand as
      <BR>far as eyes could see. Around noon, we stopped by a small mid-western
      <BR>town named Albert Lea. It was a somewhat run-down small township
      <BR>besides a lake. This town had many flat roofed concrete buildings,
      <BR>many of them painted bright red, which was different since most towns
      <BR>in eastern side have wooden houses with tiled, tapering roof.
      <BR>We went to a local post office where Pedro wanted to mail something.
      <BR>While he was in line, I had a good time observing a confident
      <BR>and cute&nbsp; 2 yr old native Indian kid giving his mom a hard time
      <BR>by trying to pull off all booklets and envelops within his reach.
      <P>We checked out a small family run pizza shop. The hostess was
      <BR>nice and friendly. Apparently not many foriegners or "out of towners"
      <BR>come to this town. So she asked as to where we were from. When I mentioned
      <BR>Long Island, she immediately started talking about the
      <BR>JFK Junior's plane crash near LI and how sad she felt for him. JFK
      <BR>Junior seemed to be a heartthrob among women in America.
      <BR>More than once I have heard american women reminiscing about him fondly.
      <BR>The pizza was good and we tipped her well!
      <P>Off we drove out of Albert Lea towards a place called Sioux Falls.
      <BR>We didn't know whether there were any falls at all. Tourbook
      <BR>mentioned a Falls park in the city. So we went. About 50 miles
      <BR>before Sioux Falls, we decided to take a small sideroad. This
      <BR>road had no signs as to where it went or where all those turns lead
      to.
      <BR>So we stopped by a small run down gas station. The area seemed quite
      <BR>poor with mostly local trucks stopping by. The girl at the station
      <BR>filled the gas and cleaned the car's windshield. When I asked for
      <BR>directions to Sioux Falls, she called her friend from inside. The reason
      <BR>I mention these details is that the this second girl had
      <BR>green eyes - the greenest I have ever seen in a human being. That
      <BR>combined with her serious looks appeared really spooky. While
      <BR>she explained the route to us in a heavy mid-west accent, the first
      <BR>girl got a souvenir for us from inside - it was a plastic tablet
      <BR>with the name of the gas station painted on it.
      <BR>"Its something for you remember us by. We don't see that many out
      <BR>of towners around here!" Me and Pedro had a small contest later
      <BR>as to who gets to keep the souvenir...I did!
      <P>Pedro wasn't convinced that the directions we got took on through
      <BR>an interesting route. So as soon as we got out of the gas station,
      <BR>he promptly took another route and drove by intuition. As always,
      <BR>his intuition was right. We passed by beautiful farmlands and
      <BR>reached Sioux Falls city. This was a somewhat bigger city
      <BR>with much more activity around evening time. I was still wondering
      <BR>if there were any falls around the place. We took
      <BR>directions to the falls park and came across a small waterfall
      <BR>with a nicely maintained park around it. There wasn't much water around
      <BR>this time of year. We hung around for a while and climbed a tower
      <BR>nearby to get a view of the city. Sioux Falls started off as
      <BR>an industrial township that grew around the Big Sioux river.
      <BR>Now it was a prominent business center. There used to be a seven
      <BR>storeyed wheat processing mill besides the water fall in early 20
      <BR>century that derived its power using water from the falls. They still
      <BR>had the ruins of the mill. Pretty cool stuff for that time.
      <P>Drove around a little bit more and left the city by taking a small
      <BR>sideroad. Somewhat rough road with no traffic in sight for miles
      <BR>and miles. Just plain farmlands. At places I saw some storage towers
      and
      <BR>farmers' houses nearby. I was wondering how it would be living
      <BR>in one of these places and had a strong urge to stop by
      <BR>one of these farmhouses and stay there for a week or so in their
      <BR>lifestyle. But that would have to wait for sometime later. Right
      <BR>now I was in a rush to go across the country and could only hope
      <BR>for a glimpse of this remote life.
      <P>I was rewarded with another beautiful sunset with a purple sky and
      <BR>this time I promptly took photographs. We joined interstate 90
      <BR>and drove to Chamberlain. Its a town by Missouri river - basically
      a
      <BR>tourist attraction. We had not booked a place this night so we hunted
      <BR>around till we came across a somewhat expensive inn called Cedar Shores
      <BR>just on the scenic banks of Missouri. Pedro and me were in a dilemma
      <BR>whether to take the room at such an expensive place and decided it
      <BR>was probably worth it. Resolved to camp the following nights to
      <BR>make up for it! I took a shower at the room, had dinner, and I went
      <BR>out to the river shore while Pedro decided to go off to sleep. After
      <BR>spending some time&nbsp; by the shore watching the reflection of town's
      <BR>lights in Missouri's flowing waters, I went back to the room resolving
      <BR>to get up early the next morning to catch the sunrise.

      <P>(to be continued...)

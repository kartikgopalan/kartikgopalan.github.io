      <h2>Mojavi Desert, "All Rightie!", Santa Barbara</h2>

<p><BR>"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied.
<BR>"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
<BR>The further off from New York the nearer is to San Frans ---
<BR>Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
<BR>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you
<BR>join the dance?
<BR>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you
<BR>join the dance?"

<BR>------------------------------------------------------------
<P>Tue 7th Sept
<BR>------------
<P>Left Las Vegas in the morning and drove into Mojave
<BR>desert. Our aim was to cross the width of California
<BR>and hit the west coast. This was going to be the
<BR>toughest test for my car thus far. We packed a
<BR>lot of water, filled the gas tank to the brim
<BR>and headed west out into the desert's wilderness.
<P>The desert stretch was more tiring than any other.
<BR>It was a hot day, but we decided to use the
<BR>air-conditioner sparingly in order to save on
<BR>gas. The highway went in a straight line for
<BR>miles and miles through the middle of the
<BR>desert. At times we saw mirages of water
<BR>far away. The land was more of hard barren brown
<BR>stretch of flat ground with sparse shrubby
<BR>vegetation than sand.
<P>It was afternoon when we hit the first town, Barstow,
<BR>after a few of hours of driving. Filled car's gas
<BR>tank and stocked more water again as a precautionary
<BR>measure and as we headed out of Barstow, we drove on
<BR>the historic Route 66 for a short stretch. Now don't
<BR>ask me what's historic about it ... the only reason
<BR>I knew about this route is because there is a brand
<BR>of Jeans that carries the name "Route 66"! I guess
<BR>this must have been one of the early routes to the
<BR>west coast.
<P>On the way, we passed through a customs checkpost.
<BR>This is where californian authorities
<BR>check passing vehicles for agricultural materials.
<BR>Apparently they are extremely paranoic about genetic
<BR>materials from outside entering the state. We were
<BR>just waved off to pass on. Had we been checked, it would
<BR>have relvealed a small pac of apples and pears.
<BR>I honestly could not understand how they can enforce
<BR>such a regulation in a foolproof manner.
<P>Next we set out to cross the remaining stretch of
<BR>Mojave. We passed by the Edwards Air Force Base
<BR>which sprawls over a rectangular stretch of desert.
<BR>We passed by many air force and army vehicles on
<BR>the road. I pulled out my binoculars to peep at
<BR>the various military structures just in case
<BR>I got to see something interesting. Finally I
<BR>could locate a line of what looked like transport
<BR>aircrafts. We approached Mojave town which had
<BR>a stretch of barren hills in the background. The
<BR>hillsides were dotted with hundreds of windmills.
<BR>I have never seen so many windmills in one place.
<BR>Presumably they supplied power to the air force base
<BR>and Mojave township down below in the valley.
<P>At Mojave town we turned south on a road that lead
<BR>directly to Los Angeles city. Sixty miles north of
<BR>LA, we headed west again into Antelope Valley.
<BR>Slowly life and vegetation began to show signs
<BR>again. A canal with crystal clear blue water was
<BR>being used to cultivate the hillsides. Finally we
<BR>hit the Coast Range of californian mountains.
<P>It was my first taste of californian life
<BR>when we stopped at a Mac Donalds in Gorman for
<BR>a late lunch. People appeared more relaxed
<BR>and friendlier than where we were coming from.
<BR>It was definitely sunnier than where we were
<BR>coming from. Southern accent - definitely
<BR>more twisted than where we were coming from.
<BR>Its "all rightie!", not a straight "all right".
<BR>( I later found that even my friend from India
<BR>who had arrived here not very long ago had caught
<BR>on to this expression!). As my English professor
<BR>at Stony Brook had pointed out, it promised to be
<BR>a different country altogether.
<BR>All rightie ... here we come CA!
<P>We decided to drive in through Los Padres
<BR>National Forest. It was miles of scenic and also
<BR>some of the most difficult mountain driving thus
<BR>far. We stopped at a point called Valley Vista
<BR>which provided view of a brown hill below with
<BR>ridges spread into neighboring valley like fingers
<BR>of a gigantic human palm. Mountainsides were
<BR>covered with yellow grasslands with cows grazing
<BR>peacefully. Amazingly there were lots of private
<BR>properties within the national forest.
<BR>We lost our way very soon on these unmarked
<BR>roads and kept guessing our exact position
<BR>in the map. When it approached sunset, we were
<BR>still entering and exiting Los Padres repeatedly
<BR>and I began wondering if I would get the sight of
<BR>the Pacific Ocean by the night.
<P>Fortunaltely we came back on the tracks and
<BR>at dusk we reached Ojai (pronounced Ohai...
<BR>you get the idea..here "j"'s dont have an
<BR>identity of their own :). We stopped for a
<BR>coffee. More "all righties" at the shop counter.
<BR>It seemed to be a small rich town. People here
<BR>seemed to be fitness freaks. Young boys and girls
<BR>were out for their evening jog while the older
<BR>lot were having brisk walks.
<P>We decide to park at Santa Barbara for the
<BR>night - the site of the all too famous
<BR>TV soap show by the same name from which
<BR>I used to shrink back in disgust while my sister
<BR>watched it religiously everyday! But I was quite
<BR>eager to see what this town was all about after
<BR>all. Pedro, who had been there before, promised it
<BR>was something to see. So we headed on route 101
<BR>along the coatline and I got the first sight of
<BR>the Pacific Ocean in my life.
<P>As we approached Santa Barbara, the sun had
<BR>already set in the horizon and had left a reddish
<BR>tinge across the skyline. All places marked on
<BR>the highway had Spanish names and Pedro appeared
<BR>to be quite happy in the familiar surroundings.
<BR>Whenever I came across a spanish name he would
<BR>gladly translate its meaning to me. Thus I learnt
<BR>that Santa Barbara and San Francisco were actually
<BR>names of early missionary saints in this region.
<P>First thing I noticed in Santa Barbara were the
<BR>palm trees along the roads. There were hardly
<BR>any multi storeyed buildings. Most buildings
<BR>were built with spanish architecture - which
<BR>got duly identified courtesy Pedro's expertise -
<BR>and were painted with creamish color.
<BR>After a bit of hunting around the town, we located
<BR>an international youth hostel called "Banana Bunglow".
<BR>It was a kind of yuppie place run by a German guy
<BR>who said he had travelled all over the world before
<BR>deciding that Santa Barbara was the place to live
<BR>in. The accomodation was cheap at $20 a person
<BR>per night. It was a small two storeyed regular
<BR>house which had fancy painting all over it
<BR>and had been torn up and redesigned inside to
<BR>give an appearance of chaos which a typical college
<BR>student loves to live in. The place was more of a
<BR>dorm with bunkered beds - eight in our small room.
<BR>There was internet access in what was once a living room
<BR>and had now been fitted with more beds. There were
<BR>shared cooking facilities where a group of students
<BR>was busy cutting vegetables.
<P>Me and Pedro dumped our luggage, had&nbsp; dinner
<BR>at a Subway, and headed into the town. First stop
<BR>was the pier along the ocean - a wooden platform
<BR>that jutted into the sea. It was a nice hangout
<BR>place with restaurants and bars. I was surprised to
<BR>see tha cars could drive onto the pier and there
<BR>was a reasonable big parking lot on it. Next we
<BR>walked through the downtown of Santa Barbara.
<BR>Pedro was esspecially happy since the whole
<BR>town had spanish culture imprinted everywhere.
<BR>Most streets has spanish names. Pedro was quick
<BR>to point out the few buildings that did not
<BR>confirm strictly to spanish architecture.
<BR>The State Street was the hub of night life. There
<BR>were pubs dotting every block where youngsters
<BR>hung out having a good time dancing and drinking.
<BR>Someone sat on the sidewalk playing a pathetic
<BR>tune on his guitar. A number of homeless people
<BR>hung around in corners even here.
<P>We woke up early morning on Wednesday and had
<BR>a walk through he town in daylight. Santa Barbara
<BR>waking up to the morning was much different
<BR>than at night. It was somewhat of a foggy morning
<BR>at sea. Someone was carefully cleaning last night's
<BR>stains and dirt from the cream colored walls of the
<BR>buildings. It appeared to be a toy town kept in
<BR>perfect shape. Number of snack shops opened up
<BR>with breakfast and coffee. We walked through the
<BR>town and went to a Catholic mission church
<BR>which was one of the earliest in this place.
<BR>It was a big stone structure that had once been
<BR>destroyed in an earthquake and then rebuilt.
<BR>The church inside was ornate and quiet - a lone
<BR>woman kneeling down and praying. After seeing
<BR>the garden in their courtyard we headed back towards
<BR>the sea. The shore had many bikers, skateboarders
<BR>and early morning joggers. After spending some
<BR>time on the beach, we headed out of Santa Barbara
<BR>in our last leg of the journey towards our
<BR>final destination - San Francisco!

      <h2>Canyons and Rendezvous with Las Vegas!!</h2>
      &nbsp;
      &nbsp;
      <BR>Monday 6th Sept
      <BR>---------------
      <P>Packed our tent for one last time in the trip today.
      <BR>Pedro and me had decided to ditch our plans for a
      <BR>grand finale at Grand Canyon. Felt Pedro couldn't
      <BR>catch his flight from San Francisco on 10th if
      <BR>we went there. Plus we had seen one too many canyons
      <BR>and creeks on the way to be able to do justice to Mr. GC.
      <BR>But hey, just north of it and not that far was Las Vegas.
      <BR>So we decided to make a go for it tonight. It was
      <BR>a long distance from where we were. But then LV's
      <BR>got to be seen by night or not at all. So let's go!
      <P>Our first stop for the day was to be at Bryce Canyon
      <BR>situated in Dixie National Forests. The vegetation
      <BR>along the drive was getting to be much sparser
      <BR>and more shrub like scattered over the hilly
      <BR>terrain of Utah. Apparently northern Utah gets a
      <BR>lot of snow in winter. One of the license plates
      <BR>on a Utah vehicle had declared "The best snow on
      <BR>earth!". Skiing must be a popular sport in this
      <BR>state. Anyway, the weather this particular day
      <BR>didn't give any suggestion that this land receives
      <BR>snow. We were on lower altitudes and it was
      <BR>getting hot as ever.
      <P>Following directions to Bryce canyon, we passed
      <BR>through a short stretch of plains and ...what did
      <BR>I tell you?...this land surprises you with sheer
      <BR>breathtaking contrasts. Across the horizon, we could
      <BR>see a line of grey hills rising out of ground
      <BR>and behind the grey hills, a stretch of completely
      <BR>red peaks rose even higher. The only piece missing
      <BR>in the scene was a full orchestra in the background
      <BR>as we approached the hills growing bigger on us!
      <BR>Ok..enough hyperbole! We were at the entrance to
      <BR>Dixie National Forests. The Red Peaks visible from
      <BR>afar belonged to the Red Canyon which extends for a
      <BR>couple of miles from the entrance. Weird
      <BR>formations have formed on the hillsides due to
      <BR>erosion over time. I immediately jumped out of
      <BR>car and started taking pictures. The drive
      <BR>through the Red Canyon was followed by more flat
      <BR>lands for next 20 miles before we reached Bryce
      <BR>Canyon. Bryce Canyon is situated in a land
      <BR>where water is scarce. But the snow in winter
      <BR>seeps in as water into cracks in rocks. There is
      <BR>a wide variation in temperature here during an
      <BR>average day. As a result, the rocks break down
      <BR>over time and the canyon keeps widening and
      <BR>churning out completely weird formations.
      <P>Apparently the best time to view the canyon
      <BR>is at sunrise or at sunset when the light plays
      <BR>tricks with eyes creating brilliant illusions
      <BR>of colors on these red rocks. Dah! We were here
      <BR>in the afternoon in searing heat and there was
      <BR>nothing that could be done about that. But
      <BR>guess what? The best pictures I took in the
      <BR>whole trip came from the Bryce Canyon! The afternoon
      <BR>sky was clear blue and contrasted perfectly against
      <BR>the red walls of the canyon. We decided to take
      <BR>a&nbsp; three mile trek through the canyon. Starting
      <BR>off from Sunrise point, we climbed down the
      <BR>slopes. Grand view of a group of rock formations
      <BR>that looked like carefully placed pieces on
      <BR>a chess board. There were natural holes punched
      <BR>on the sides of the canyon that looked like
      <BR>bridges. The bottom of the canyon had trails
      <BR>of a dry stream. The end of the trek at Sunset point
      <BR>was an extremely steep climb 850 feet up the
      <BR>sides of canyon for more breathtaking views.
      <BR>With time only to cover this fraction of the
      <BR>portion of Bryce, we drove out, back through
      <BR>the Red Canyon and towards Zion Natinal Park.
      <P>Zion is another natural wonder. At the entrance
      <BR>to the Zion, there are a set of hills. Its as
      <BR>if each is made out of single rock and someone has
      <BR>carefully placed very very regular deep rectangular
      <BR>stripes across all its sides - most strange hill
      <BR>I have ever seen. Its called Chequerboard Mesa.
      <BR>Drive further into Zion took us through a series
      <BR>of tunnels with high rocky hills on all sides.
      <BR>The longest of the tunnels was 2 Kms long.
      <BR>(And yes! for some strange reason, they started
      <BR>using the metric system here to mark the
      <BR>distances. Only place in U.S. so far where I
      <BR>have seen metric system being used.) It was a
      <BR>single lane one way traffic in the tunnel with
      <BR>the traffic in one direction being stopped till
      <BR>a group of vehicles from the other direction cleared
      <BR>through. The Zion Canyon is somewhat ensconsed
      <BR>and hidden away in the middle of the forests. It
      <BR>must have taken considerable persistence on part
      <BR>of the early adventurers to reach here. Beyond
      <BR>the tunnels began our descent to the base of
      <BR>the canyon. The narrow road going down had
      <BR>frequent hairpin bends. Halfway down, I could
      <BR>see strange big arches cut into the rocky
      <BR>walls of the canyon - like someone's great
      <BR>throne.
      <P>At the bottom, the road follows the Virgin
      <BR>River in a long scenic drive. This Monday being
      <BR>a Labor day holiday, there was considerable crowd
      <BR>and as a result, lot of vehicular traffic. Cars
      <BR>were parked at all possible nook and corners
      <BR>along the road and I wondered if this was more
      <BR>like a picnic area than a protected
      <BR>national forest. With so many man made constructions
      <BR>that I saw along the canyons bottom, I just had to
      <BR>conjure up images in my mind of how the place
      <BR>would have looked like before man stepped in here.
      <P>Our first stop was at the head of a trail which
      <BR>went up half amile along the canyon's walls to
      <BR>a place called Weeping Rocks. This is a great
      <BR>arch on the walls on the canyon with water from
      <BR>some small stream dripping down slowly along
      <BR>its edges. All kinds of strange creepers, fungi and
      <BR>plants grow besides on the walls so that they
      <BR>are called the Hanging Gardens. We could actually
      <BR>walk under the dripping water and into the shade
      <BR>of the arch to observe the place. The place was
      <BR>pretty slippery, still a bunch of toddlers and
      <BR>kids were jumping around in water and slush having
      <BR>a great time. One of the parents told his 5 year
      <BR>old girl not to get wet by going under the falling
      <BR>water. The girl promptly proceeded to get herself
      <BR>drenched under the tiny waterfall and called after her
      <BR>father "Dad! Why don't you come in too? Its
      <BR>real fun!!"
      <P>Next we drover further to the tip of canyon - a place
      <BR>called "The Temple of Sinawava". Its a semi circular
      <BR>area surrounded by high rocky walls with small streams
      <BR>flowing in from around to join the Virgin river.
      <BR>The place was absolutely packed with cars with no
      <BR>parking space and people having picnic all around the
      <BR>stream. We couldn't get a parking spot there and decided
      <BR>to head back through the canyon. Halfway through, we
      <BR>stopped to take a 2 mile trail to a set of three pools
      <BR>called the "Emrald Pools" - the upper, middle and
      <BR>lower pools. I proceeded ahead alone as Pedro went
      <BR>searching for something at a nearby lodge and said he
      <BR>would follow me. The trek took me along the rim of the
      <BR>canyon and provided great overlooks of the rocky faces
      <BR>of the canyon from various points. Pedro caught up
      <BR>with me pretty soon. We visited the
      <BR>middle and the lower pools. One had to trek 3 miles
      <BR>further to reach the upper pool and there was no time for that.
      <BR>I would rather call them "puddles" of water since
      <BR>there is little water flowing along the streams at
      <BR>this time of the year. But the trek peaceful.
      <BR>Back at the bottom of the canyon, we had coffee at
      <BR>a lodge while looking from the windows
      <BR>at a magnificent view of a towering red rock face of
      <BR>the canyon in front.
      <P>It was getting close to evening now and our aim was
      <BR>to reach Las Vegas by night if we were to get to see
      <BR>its famed night life. We wanted to book a room
      <BR>in advance of getting there. There were at least a
      <BR>thousand rooms in each of the big lodges or hotels listed
      <BR>in the tourbook. We finally located a hotel that suited
      <BR>our budget. Apparently it also doubled up as a casino,
      <BR>but it was supposed to be one of the lesser mortals
      <BR>in the city of the rich and mighty. So from the bottom
      <BR>of a deep canyon in the middle of a nowhere forest in Utah,
      <BR>I dialled a number 150 miles away in a desert city
      <BR>called Las Vegas and booked our rendezvous for the night!
      <P>We drove out of the Zion Canyon and took the nearest
      <BR>interstate freeway # 15 heading towards LV. After
      <BR>crossing the Utah border, we drove through a brief
      <BR>30 mile stretch of Arizona. Landscape now consisted
      <BR>of absolutely barren grey hillsides. For a stretch,
      <BR>we had to drive westwards and the glare from the
      <BR>setting sun would blind us from the front. I
      <BR>had a hard time keeping by car in the lane. The speed
      <BR>limit here was 75 miles per hour and people easily
      <BR>drove at 90 or 100. For our loaded Hyundai driving on
      <BR>a hilly road, even 65 is a great feat! The traffic
      <BR>was pretty heavy. There were signs which warned that
      <BR>these highways were patrolled by aircraft. Apparently
      <BR>the cops just take note down the registration number
      <BR>of speedsters from up in the sky and mail a ticket
      <BR>to your home address..nice, you get roasted
      <BR>and you don't even realize...at least till later :)
      <P>Once we entered Nevada, the landscape became more
      <BR>valley like with barren hills on the horizon. We drove
      <BR>through miles of desert having just small bushes and
      <BR>shrubs for vegetation. At one point, we realized we
      <BR>were low on gas and needed to refuel. I was warned that
      <BR>in Nevada, you can drive for a couple of hundred miles
      <BR>without encountering any sign of habitation, let alone
      <BR>gas stations. Alarmed, we took the next exit which
      <BR>showed gas with an arrow pointing into nowhere in the
      <BR>forsaken desert. Many miles into the exit and we still
      <BR>couldn't trace even a faintest sign of any town or
      <BR>village. After about five miles, we reached a small town
      <BR>by the side of a small pond in the middle of the desert.
      <BR>Gas prices were, of course, sky high. While refuelling,
      <BR>got to peacefully watch a beautiful sunset over the o
      <BR>desert skyline. Small reward for long detour! Drove back
      <BR>five miles back on the highway towards LV.
      <P>By the time we reached the outskirts of Las Vegas,
      <BR>it was night. In order to get into the Vegas mood,
      <BR>we decided to tune into the local FM stations. Immediately
      <BR>I was hearing the sounds of Frank Sinatra filtering into
      <BR>car. Sinatra is apparently a legend in this city which
      <BR>breathes his music every day. Ironically, one of his
      <BR>numbers which I heard repeatedly here was
      <BR>"New York! New York!" :) As the highway entered the
      <BR>city from over the hills, down beneath in the valley,
      <BR>in the center of a desolate desert, there were a
      <BR>million glittering golden lights of the city. It was an
      <BR>amazing and crazy sight. It required an exremely
      <BR>high level ingenuity and&nbsp; insanity for someone to
      <BR>land up in the middle of nowhere in a desert and
      <BR>decide to erect the biggest and most famous gambling
      <BR>city in the world with its two hundred thousand
      <BR>inhabitants making a living out of this business.
      <P>As crazy and fantastic as it appeared from a distance,
      <BR>it appeared more insane as we drove into it. My first
      <BR>impression of the city was that of a clown with a
      <BR>perpetually smiling face mask to entertain his daily
      <BR>train of customers. There was glitter and pomp
      <BR>everywhere. Every neon sign was for some casino, hotel,
      <BR>motel,free buffets, million dollar gambling prizes
      <BR>and what not. Every inch of the exterior entire
      <BR>buildings were illuminated with bright colored lights
      <BR>to attract maximum attention. Even grocery stores and
      <BR>gas stations had slot machines lines up so that people
      <BR>could try their luck anytime, anywhere.
      <P>We checked into our hotel (which had&nbsp; a decent number
      <BR>of slot machines lined up from the entrance to the dining cafe).
      <BR>It was a pretty good room for a cheap price.
      <BR>The food and lodging in this city are supposed
      <BR>to be cheap so that people can spend more money gambling.
      <BR>Freshened up with a hot shower and had dinner at a nearby
      <BR>Indian restaurant called "Gandhi Restaurant" - poor
      <BR>Gandhiji turning in his grave. Finally we walked onto
      <BR>the streets to have a taste of Las Vegas.
      <BR>Many `Noveau riche` of the city drove around on
      <BR>the four lane city roads in flashy convertibles,
      <BR>classy limousines and loud motorbikes.
      <BR>Every third car had loud music on its stereo, mad look in
      <BR>the its driver's eyes, and speed in its wheels.
      <BR>A merry and happily drunk couple were swaying on the
      <BR>sidewalk.
      <P>The crowd knew how to dress for the night. Men young and old,
      <BR>in formal suits, gelled hairs, cigars in mouth and
      <BR>stern straight look in eyes. Women, young and old, in
      <BR>flashy dresses, high heels, fat purses. And, just like in
      <BR>any other big city of U.S., there was other part of the crowd
      <BR>too - homeless people in rags, mostly blacks and hispanics,
      <BR>hanging around street corners, accosting passerbys for
      <BR>small change, handing out advertisement pamphlets or
      <BR>just lost in the world.
      <P>Towering over this melting pot of people were the
      <BR>tall flashy glittering multi-storeyed casinos. Ballagio
      <BR>was a casino with a sprawling garden. There was a musical
      <BR>fountain show every half hour in which fountains danced
      <BR>to the tunes of Frank Sinatra's songs. Caesar's Palace
      <BR>was another one in which they try to recreate the original
      <BR>palace of Caesar. Different areas in this five-star
      <BR>casino were designed to give the effect of walking through
      <BR>the open streets of Rome and were called by Roman names.
      <BR>The amount of money they put in to maintain this world of
      <BR>make believe is amazing. Paris was a casino bult in
      <BR>the shape of Eiffel Tower. The interiors resemled the
      <BR>streets of Paris. The ceiling was so painted and lighted
      <BR>to give the impression that we were walking under open
      <BR>skies. The employees and even the customers wore typical
      <BR>french dresses. Young women looking like french models
      <BR>sat along the benches of this make believe streets
      <BR>with cigars in their mouth and exuding typical cool
      <BR>looks of the french. Another casino was called New York.
      <BR>It had two building, one resembling the Empite State
      <BR>building and the other resembling the Chrysler building.
      <BR>There were bridges with conveyer belts connecting different
      <BR>casinos to each other. This way people could move around
      <BR>between casinos easily and the owners of casinos happily
      <BR>shared the money these customers had to offer.
      <P>The main playing area looked the same at all casinos.
      <BR>Young and rich men with their women sat at table games
      <BR>and played high stakes. Old retired people
      <BR>sat alone at slot machines, spending away their life's
      <BR>savings quarter by quarter. The continuous music
      <BR>emenating from slot machines filled the background
      <BR>and sounded like incantations for money.
      <BR>The night shows in Las Vegas are another famous feature.
      <BR>We checked the prices but it was more expensive than
      <BR>we thought and we decided against it.
      <P>What's visiting Las Vegas without a little gambling.
      <BR>So I played exactly a dollar at one of the slot machines.
      <BR>Each of the four quarters dutifully vanished into the machine
      <BR>like a black hole! It had been a long day
      <BR>and we stumbled back to our hotel room for a good night's
      <BR>rest. Goal for the next day - cross the Mojavi desert
      <BR>and hit the Santa Barbara on the west coast!

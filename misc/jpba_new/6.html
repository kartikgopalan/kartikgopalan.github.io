      <h2>Welcome to Wyoming : Like No Other Place On Earth!</h2>
      2nd Sept
      <BR>--------
      <P>Great Day. Got out of Spear Fish. It was a cloudy morning and was threatening
      to rain.
      <BR>We drove into Wyoming with our final destination for the day being
      Cody. At the border
      <BR>of Wyoming a board declared "Welcome to Wyoming : Like No Other Place
      On Earth!".
      <BR>And true to its name, I haven't seen a place like this anywhere else.
      Our first
      <BR>encounter with Wyoming's nature was a stretch of low misty clouds that
      we ran into
      <BR>for a long stretch. In the limited visibility, the stretch of land
      I could see
      <BR>had yellow and wavy appearance. The trees and hills had a ghostlike
      appearance
      <BR>amid the hanging clouds. I don't have enough words to describe the
      morning as it was
      <BR>but it had a bewitching beauty. And since Pedro was in charge of the
      wheels, I got
      <BR>myself busy clicking pictures even through the dew that started forming
      on the windshield.
      <BR>We drove through Gillette which is an oil and coal town. Like all industrial
      towns,
      <BR>it had a shabby appearance. An unmanned gas station there wouldn't
      accept my credit card.
      <BR>A railroad station nearby didn't seem to have a soul around the place.
      <P>We next drove towards Buffalo which sits at the tip of Rocky mountain
      ranges. Another small
      <BR>midwest town which had legends of war between native Indians and westerners.
      Most Indians
      <BR>got butchered in the wars and now the surviving descendants live in
      reservations. It had
      <BR>a war memorial for everyone from the town who had died in a fight ever
      since the American
      <BR>civil war. Had lunch at a restaurant called Busy Bee restaurant. It
      was a small homely restaurant
      <BR>where lots of old timers seemed to hang around. Everyone knew everyone
      else and we seemed to
      <BR>be the only strangers around the place. It was a particularly cold
      day that morning
      <BR>and I had to pull out my sweaters. Pedro had apparently come unprepared
      for this cold - something
      <BR>that struck me later as quite strange for a person initially planning
      to travel in Canada!
      <BR>But he insisted on roaming around in shorts and T-shirt! Brave man
      :)
      <P>We stopped for coffee at another shop. The girl there was friendly and
      while preparing our
      <BR>Cappucino she told us stories about her trip to India and China. "So
      where are you guys heading
      <BR>to?". "San Francisco". "Wow! That's along way from New York. So, you'll
      be visiting the
      <BR>whole of United States on the way. How many days are you planning to
      take? A month?".
      <BR>"No just 10 days. We are just passing by."&nbsp; And that's where I
      got the title for this
      <BR>series - "Just Passing By America"! We got directions to go to Thermopolis
      from the girl
      <BR>and headed out of Buffalo.
      <P>Soon we drove into Big Horn national forests. These were similar to
      Black forests
      <BR>with mountains at high elevation. As we went higher, we ran into thick
      cloud cover.
      <BR>Visibility was poor again but it seemed like a dream driving through
      those clouds
      <BR>with only ghostly outlines of the forest and the mountains visible
      to us. At the
      <BR>highest elevation (exactly 9666 feet!), we got a great clear view&nbsp;
      of the hills.
      <BR>From this point onwards, we kept driving downhill. Suddenly we found
      ourselves
      <BR>driving through the middle of a creek with steep rocky walls jutting
      out on both
      <BR>sides and a small stream flowing through the middle. This, I later
      found is, the Powder
      <BR>River Pass which is at the entrance to the town of Tensleep. We just
      had to stop
      <BR>and get out on many of the pullouts along the road where I took many
      pictures of
      <BR>the creek. The road wound down along its walls and finally passed through
      the
      <BR>bottom of the creek providing views of the creek from every angle.
      <P>Immediately after Tensleep, we drove through a long stretch of Route
      16
      <BR>between Tensleep and Worland. This stretch presented a stark contrast
      to the
      <BR>lush green Bighorn forests. At first sight I thought it was a desert.
      In fact these
      <BR>are the badlands of Wyoming. The land here is completely yellow and
      barren with
      <BR>very little vegetation. I did not see such a desolate stretch of land
      again till I
      <BR>reached Nevada desert. Many oil wells dotted the horizon here pumping
      oil from as
      <BR>deep as 10000 feet in the ground.
      <P>After Worland, we reached Thermopolis - my first sight of hotsprings.
      At the entrance
      <BR>at the town, there is a huge banner painted on a side of a hill claiming
      <BR>"The largest hotsprings in the world" with an arrow pointing to where
      the hotsprings are.
      <BR>Largest or not, it was very beautiful. The whole place smelled of sulphur
      <BR>and I was to carry that smell in my nose well after we left the place.
      Hotsprings
      <BR>are basically sources of hot water from beneath the ground. Not very
      far under the
      <BR>ground are high temperatures from which the water gets heated and comes
      out through vents.
      <BR>There were quite a few pools of hot springs around the place with vapors
      rising from them
      <BR>as if in a fairy tale. Where the water flowed down the gradient, different
      colored
      <BR>fungi had grown depending upon the temperature of the water flowing
      there. It looked like
      <BR>a deliberate painting by an artist. Apparently, native Sioux Indians
      used to have annual
      <BR>ritual baths at this place till the U.S. government bought the land
      from their chief for
      <BR>a price of $60,000 in order to preserve the springs. At the origin
      of one of the springs,
      <BR>I could see hot water emerging out of the ground. The pool appeared
      bottomless
      <BR>with big leaf shaped dark green fungi growing along its sides. Bubbles
      rose from beneath
      <BR>out of nowhere making weird sounds. It was as if the hot waters were
      rising right
      <BR>out of hell. Totally cool.
      <P>Out of Thermopolis, we drove into Wind River Canyon. Of course, Wind
      River winds
      <BR>through this canyon. This is also supposed to be have Indian reservations.
      I even thought
      <BR>I saw a teepee (Indian tent house). The drive took us through three
      small tunnels.
      <BR>The walls of the canyon were more majestic than in
      <BR>Powder River Pass. At the end of the canyon, we came across a huge
      man made reservoir.
      <BR>It was a great unexpected view. As it began to rain, we headed on our
      way back through
      <BR>the canyon towards Cody.
      <P>Cody lies right at the mouth of Yellowstone National Park. We had a
      cabin booked
      <BR>at one of KOA campgrounds (KOA = Kampgrounds of America). My first
      stay at a campground.
      <BR>Promptly became a KOA member for $10 as it meant I got 10% discount
      at any
      <BR>campground - it wasn't very long before I recovered the membership
      fees with our
      <BR>repeated stays at campgrounds. It was a neat campground and a comfortable
      wooden cabin
      <BR>with 4 beds, two each bunkered on opposite walls of the cabin. After
      having bagels and
      <BR>bread for dinner and planning our trip to Yellowstone the next day,
      Pedro went off to sleep
      <BR>while I sat outside on the porch in a cold night and logged my visits.

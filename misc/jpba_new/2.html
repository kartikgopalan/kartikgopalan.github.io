      <p><b><U>27th August</U></b></p>

      <p><BR>The
      day before we left, me and Pedro visited the local malls and bought
      an odd assortment of items ranging from a hammer, some spanners,
      cooling bag, a rain repellent coating for car's windshield, and lots
      of eatables for the way. In my hurry I had forgotten to buy a camera,
      but since I had a disposable one for the moment from my earlier visit
      to a Mets/Cardinals game in NY, I decided not to worry about it till
      later in the trip.  How could one miss out a camera from shopping
      list before leaving on such a trip?? ... well, that's me :)

<p><b><U>28th August</U></b></p>

<P><BR>
Saturday morning of
28th Aug. we were all set to go. I bade goodbye to my housemates and
we drove off to the nearest gas station where I bought a gauge to
measure tire pressure. It was a nice, sunny and perfect day to set
out on the trip. We took the Northern State Parkway out of Long
Island into New York City.</p>

</p>
<P><BR>
 Once we joined the road leading to George
Washington Bridge, the going was really slow at the rate of 10 miles
per hour.  It was to be the slowest drives in the whole trip. I am
not a great fan of New York traffic and was glad to be getting away
from it for a long long time. Driving on the upper deck of GW Bridge,
I got my last sight of the impressive Manhattan skyline. 
</p>
<P>We took Route 80, which
actually goes all the way west to San Francisco if you bother never
to get out of it. But that's not really what an adventure is made of,
is it? </p>

</p>
<P>Our destination for the day was to reach my brother's place in
Penn State University by the evening. The drive through New Jersey
was absolutely boring. Only thing good about the drive is that the
gas prices are one of the lowest I have seen anywhere in U.S.  But
then they offset it by charging tolls once too often.  Once we
decided to stop for lunch, it was impossible to find an exit  with a
decent food joint. Finally we located a Diner and Pedro decided to
try out American chilli for the first time. It proved to be hot in
both ways - spicy and burnt his tongue! I stuck to a good old
omelette. Another stop at a CITGO gas station, which was run by a
sardarji, and we entered Pennsylvania. This part of the trip was much
better with a great drive through the lush green hills. I started
clicking away with my disposable camera. It was more or less an
uneventful drive the first day and we reached State College by 7:00
in the evening where my brother Venkat ( or Venky as we call him) and
his wife Veena stay. Veena had cooked a great multi-course Indian
dinner in anticipation of our arrival. Her cooking skills are
absolutely incomparable and this was the last proper dinner we were
to have for rest of the trip! The VVs showed great interest in our
trip plan and the places we were to visit on the way, and Venky's
refrain was that he was envious of and happy for me as I was doing
what he had long wanted to do. 
</p>

<p><b><U>29th August</U></b></p>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Early
morning next day, we bid our goodbyes, bought some foodstuffs and
drove out of State College with the arrangement that I was to call
VVs every night wherever I stopped on the way. See...guardian angels
:)  It was a long drive out to the border of Pennsylvania as the
state is really wide! Route 80 itself is quite beautiful in this
stretch but we decided to explore further and took side roads, which
basically ran parallel to the interstate but passed through
countryside towns and villages. There were signs of deer crossing all
along the roads, but the only deer we saw were those that had been
run over by some passing vehicle. Too bad. Towards the western border
of Pennsylvania, the hills began to fade away and were replaced by a
more regular terrain.  
<P><img src="kartik's%20cross-country%20journey,%201999_html_680f587.jpg">
</p>
</p>
<P>Next we entered Ohio and
we were again on the interstate 80, with traffic much sparser and
consisting mostly of trucks. Pedro and myself had been swapping our
driving turns whenever we stopped for gas, food or at rest areas. The
rest areas for public are really neat along the highways, something
that impressed me a lot. Some even have free coffee for sleepy
drivers! Neither of us had really stretched the vehicle very much,
partly because of the speed limit and also because we were aware that
it was loaded - you could say it was &quot;back heavy&quot;. On the
stretch of Ohio, the limit got higher around 70 mph and I figured out
that a loaded Hyundai could do 80 mph plus with ease. With good
reason Pedro kept warning me to slow down.  </p>
<P>Pedro: "After
reaching San Francisco, drive at whatever speed you want, but not on
the way!"
<br>
Me: "Yes sir!" 
</p>
<P>We had been on the
interstate for too long and wanted to take some side roads. Pedro
decided to navigate by intuition and gave me directions to drive in
the general direction towards north.  
</p>
Me: "Hey,
do you know where exactly we are on the map right now?"
<BR>Pedro: "No. But don't worry. Just keep
driving as I tell you?" <BR>Me: "Have you
been here before?" <BR>Pedro: "No."
<BR>Me: "Huh?!"
</p>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>And so we
went on, driving through a lot of side roads. For the benefit of
those readers outside U.S., each road in this country is identified
by a number, as you must have figured out by now. I choose not to
list them in this account for obvious reasons of that being
uninteresting...so you'll find the phrase &quot;we drove through lot
of side roads&quot; recurring throughout my accounts. 
</p>
<P>Suddenly I found myself
driving by the shore of what appeared to be a sea?  For a moment I
was zapped since I thought we were driving towards the middle of U.S.
 Soon I figured out that this was Lake Erie, one of the five in Great
Lakes region and also the source of famous Niagara Falls that I had
visited a few weeks earlier. I now gained a healthy respect for
Pedro's sense of direction. Later throughout the trip, whenever we
entered a new township or city, I'd give over the controls to Pedro.
He would locate the downtown for the town in no time using his `sixth
sense' and take us where the action in the town really was. Cool.
</p>
<p><img src="kartik's%20cross-country%20journey,%201999_html_34b01766.jpg"><BR>
</p>
<P>The shores of Lake Erie
seemed to be inhabited by rich people. There were many private
beaches and sporting activity seemed to abound. Quite a beautiful
area. We reached Sheldon where there is a protected area called
&quot;<a href="lake_eerie_area_brown_marshlands.jpg">Brown
Marshlands</A></U>&quot;. I had never seen
a marshland before so this was a new experience. This area is known
for rare birds, insects and plants. The air was filled with sounds of
crickets. Walk along a mile of narrow road took us along the sides of
the marshland. Brown surface of marshes were absolutely plain without
any frills and from a distance, it was hard to tell whether it was
solid land or just some dirt covering the surface of a pond. The road
led to Lake Erie. We hung around for a while around an abandoned NASA
pumping station by the shore and while running to escape some waves,
I almost disposed off my disposable camera into water.  
</p>
<P>Found our way back to
route 80 and just drove then onwards towards Elkhart, Indiana where
we had booked a room in Best Western Inn for the night.  Another
feature peculiar to the stretch of roads this far was that we had to
pay tolls very frequently all along route 80. The more toll they
charged, the worse the roads used to be. Thus far, all trucks in Penn
and Ohio used to stay on the right lane and travelled well below
speed limit.  This gave me the impression that truckers in this
country are really well behaved and care about safe driving. Once we
entered Indiana, it seemed as if cops don't patrol these highways at
all. For the first time in the whole trip, we had trucks
overtaking us at 90 mph. More trucks overtook us at
higher speeds in this stretch than anywhere in the whole trip did. 
And for those who don't know, trucks in this country are really big
and long.... not like the rickety small ones that speed on India's
highways. Passing by a truck, you feel like you are passing by a
train ... okay I am exaggerating but that kind of sums up the way it
feels to be driving besides one of these dinosaurs. 
</p>
<P>Anyway, we reached
safely at Elkhart. The inn was nice and had even had an indoor
swimming pool. Pedro, a swimming enthusiast, had his face lit up at
the news but soon changed his mind when he saw that it was a small
pool and even that had a bunch of kids jumping around in water. We
moved into our room, checked out the weather for next day which
seemed okay, but had rain predicted later in the week in our journey,
had dinner outside and planned our trip next day to Chicago and
Madison.

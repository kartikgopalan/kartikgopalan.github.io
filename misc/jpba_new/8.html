      <h2>Hiking at Grand Teton</h2>
      ...getting there...but not quite yet!
      <P>Sat Sept 4th'99
      <BR>---------------
      <P>The morning at Moran camp had a little surprise.
      <BR>Out behind the clouds, we could see outlines of the
      <BR>magnificent snowcapped peaks of Grand Teton. A closer
      <BR>look at them was for later in the day. We drove through
      <BR>the no man's land and could see much more in daylight
      <BR>than we could driving the previous night. The plan
      <BR>for the day was quite simple. Visit the geysers
      <BR>of Yellowstone, get back to Grand Teton national Park,
      <BR>spend the day there and then camp at Bear Lake.
      <P>The most famous geyser in Yellowstone is the
      <BR>Old Faithful geyser. It is so called since for ages
      <BR>it has been spewing out huge bursts of water at an interval
      <BR>of more or less every 45 minutes to one hour. There
      <BR>are a bunch of other geysers around Old Faithful
      <BR>that are not so faithful, but quite magnificent
      <BR>when they do erupt. Back at the entrance of YellowStone,
      <BR>we asked the guard about the timing of next eruption
      <BR>for Old Faithful. Surprisingly she didn't know!
      <BR>Anyway, if we had to see it, we had to see it, no
      <BR>matter how long the wait.
      <P>After a long drive through the forests of
      <BR>Yellowstone, we reached Old Faithful village.
      <BR>There are extensive walkways constructed
      <BR>around the geysers with Old Faithful being the
      <BR>center of attraction. The information center
      <BR>declared that OF was to erupt in ten minutes.
      <BR>So me and Pedro blended into the waiting crowd,
      <BR>everyone ready with their cameras and camcorders.
      <BR>The geyser itself is like a big boil on the
      <BR>surface of earth with a cone at the center.
      <BR>Steam rose from the cone and water kept
      <BR>splashing out sporadically as the water pressure under
      <BR>the ground steadily built up. Every time,
      <BR>a big splash occurred, the crowd would get restless
      <BR>hoping this would be THE eruption. When the eruption
      <BR>did start, it was nothing like I have ever seen before.
      <BR>Huge volumes of hot water shot up to 30 feet from
      <BR>surface like an enormous fountain. An amazing sight.
      <BR>The eruption lasted for almost five minutes before dying
      <BR>down. Great pictures.
      <P>Having paid our respects to the Old Faithful, we moved on
      <BR>to other geysers. There were innumerable of them. Some
      <BR>were small fissures in the ground. Some were big pools with
      <BR>a small fountainlike spring in the center and a floor with
      <BR>sky blue color. Some looked like cancerous wounds on the
      <BR>earth's surface. One was shaped like an ear. The walkway
      <BR>passed so close to one of the erupting geysers that
      <BR>water sprayed over me - not as hot as I expected. There
      <BR>was a Grand Geyser which erupted once in 12 hours.
      <BR>Some erupted once in a few days. One was shaped like a
      <BR>castle and showed considerable activity. Very interesting
      <BR>and unique place.
      <P>Happy at having seen the most famous feature of Yellowstone,
      <BR>we moved on towards Grand Teton. Grand Teton lies just
      <BR>south of Yellowstone. One more journey southwards on the
      <BR>same path to get out of Yellowstone. But this was more
      <BR>rewarding. The road going south on the western side of 8 loop
      <BR>crosses the continental divide thrice. Continental divide
      <BR>is basically a fault in earth's crust on American continent
      <BR>that runs from north to south all across. As a result,
      <BR>streams originating on the eastern side drain in the
      <BR>direction of the Atlantic Ocean whereas streams originating
      <BR>on the western side drain towards the Pacific. We stopped
      <BR>by one of these locations where there were actually two streams,
      <BR>one draining in east and other in west. Absolutely cool
      <BR>effect! Again I got myself `Patel` photographed against the
      <BR>signpost, pretending to hold the divide together.
      <P>The road approaching Grand Teton provided an amazing
      <BR>frontal view of the mountain ranges. Our ticket for Yellowstone
      <BR>was valid to Grand Teton as well - great deal for 10 bucks.
      <BR>The national park is basically a valley surrounded by the
      <BR>Teton mountain ranges that tower over its background. Ages
      <BR>ago there was no valley, but after some major earthquakes and
      <BR>shifts in tectonic plates, the surface caved in
      <BR>creating what is now a beautiful valley. To reach the ranges,
      <BR>one has to hike on extensive trails, something for which we didn't
      <BR>have much time. All the same we decided to take a smaller trail
      <BR>besides Jenny Lake which led to Hidden Falls. To reach Jenny Lake,
      <BR>we had to drive through the middle of the flat valley populated
      <BR>by tiny shrubs and millions of crickets making their typical sound.
      <BR>It was great pulling out at some spots and getting to look at the
      <BR>towering ranges on all sides. My binoculars found
      <BR>extensive use again in exploring the nitty gritty details
      <BR>of the glaciers that sat cosily near the peaks.
      <P>Near Jenny Lake, we parked our car and started out
      <BR>on the trail. People returning on the trail seemed flush
      <BR>and happy and every passer by wished a friendly "hi" or "hello"....
      <BR>something strange but refreshing for me-straight-faced-New-Yorker :-|
      <BR>There were many old people who took the trail with enthusiasm.
      <BR>Many families with 3 and 4 year olds in the group too. It was a
      <BR>long 3 mile trail through thickly wooded forests that took us
      <BR>along the banks of Jenny Lake on one side and steeply rising
      <BR>sides of the Teton ranges on the other side. Initially I was
      <BR>in a rush to reach the falls as soon as possible but soon
      <BR>realized that was not the way to enjoy a hike. So I slowed down
      <BR>and took my time clicking photos of wild berries and flowers
      <BR>and watching canoes and motorboats on the peaceful lake.
      <BR>Finally we heard the wooshing sounds of
      <BR>the falls. True to its name, I couldn't see the falls even when
      <BR>the sound&nbsp; of water seemd to surround the forest and streams
      <BR>flowed out from evrywhere. Only after getting very close
      <BR>and from certain angle, I could see the falls. It wasn't
      <BR>very impressive, perhaps because this wasn't the season for
      <BR>excess water. We hiked back on the trail, more slowly than
      <BR>before. Passed by a father with four toddlers having a tough time
      <BR>convincing them to walk the rest of the trail. Lot of
      <BR>folks heading towards the falls kept asking us how far it
      <BR>was...and so we walked on till we reached the parking lot,
      <BR>had coffee watching the mountain ranges and drove out.
      <P>As the sun was setting behind the Teton ranges, the whole valley
      <BR>was bathed in golden yellow with long shadows of the
      <BR>ranges slowly creeping upon the valley. It was the most beautiful
      <BR>sunset behind the mountains I have seen. Unfortunately I had
      <BR>exhausted my stock of film rolls...so no pictures of this amazing
      <BR>scene :(
      <P>Pedro meanwhile switched on the FM channel on the radio to
      <BR>check if any stations reach this remote place and surprisingly we
      <BR>could catch a few. One of the poplar songs was playing.
      <BR>Its a different kind of song in which the lead guy "speaks"
      <BR>out light philosophical advice (very similar to the TODAY'S GEMS
      <BR>from Srichie :) with music in the background. One of the
      <BR>advice he gave was "Live in New York some time in your life
      <BR>but leave before it makes you too hard. Live in
      <BR>Northern California sometime in your life, but leave before
      <BR>it makes you too soft!"....and here I was...bang...relocating
      <BR>between exactly these very two places!
      <P>As we drove further, the roads took us through one valley after
      <BR>another, each one more beautiful than the other. Mountains
      <BR>surrounding the velleys were yellow and the valleys themselves
      <BR>were covered with golden grasslands or had farms with tiny
      <BR>hamlets sitting in the middle. Light from the setting sun would
      <BR>fall at an angle from behind the mountains and paint the
      <BR>valley with magical golden and orange hues. Amazing beauty.
      <P>We passed through final miles of wilderness of Wyoming
      <BR>and covering a small stretch of Idaho into Utah. It was night
      <BR>when we reach the KOA kampgrounds at Garden City which is by
      <BR>the banks of Bear Lake. It was the Labor Day weekend and the
      <BR>campground was packed with outdoor loving holiday crowd with
      <BR>their RVs and water-sport gears. There were many high school going
      <BR>kids working that night at the camp managing the customers on their
      <BR>bikes and holding starwar-like green torchlights in their hands. We
      <BR>managed to rent one spot&nbsp; of ground just enough to pitch Pedro's
      <BR>tent for the first time in the trip. Pedro unpacked his camping
      <BR>gear. Since I had no prior experience setting up a tent, I stood
      <BR>by showing the torch light while he unfolded the tiny package
      <BR>and assembeled it into a neat tent. Took many precautions to
      <BR>prevent flies from getting into the tent. It was a cold night, close
      <BR>to 40 Farenhite. I slept soundly, tired from the day's 6 mile hike.
      <BR>But Pedro felt the chill and didn't sleep. When we woke up in the
      <BR>morning next day, there was a thin sheet of ice on the roof
      <BR>of the car...
      <P>...but more about next day the next time - our journey through
      <BR>the promised land of Mormons into The Salt Lake City.

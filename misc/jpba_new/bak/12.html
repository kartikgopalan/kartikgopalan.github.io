<P>...Thus grew the tale of Wonderland:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus slowly, one by one,
<BR>Its quaint events were hammered out-
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now the tale is done,
<BR>And home we steer, a merry crew,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath the setting sun.
<P>Alice! a childish story take,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and with a gentle hand
<BR>Lay it where Childhood's dreams are twined
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Memory's mystic band,
<BR>Like a pilgrim's withered wreath of flowers
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plucked in a far-off land.
<BR>---------------------------------------------
<BR>Wed 8th Sept. '99
<BR>-----------------
<P>Out from Santa Barbara, we drove north
<BR>on route 101 along the shoreline. We passed
<BR>through a lot of farms - stretches of flat
<BR>green cultivated land which resembled the rice
<BR>fields of South India. Most of the farm
<BR>workers were Hispanics and had a rustic look
<BR>which was quite different from any people I had
<BR>seen in other parts of this country.
<P>After passing by Santa Maria, we stopped at
<BR>Pismo Beach along the rocky shoreline and
<BR>had our lunch while watching a group of wave
<BR>surfers. This was the first time I was seeing
<BR>anyone wave surfing. Its a curious ritual to
<BR>watch. The surfer would patiently lie flat on
<BR>his surfboard for something like 10 to 15 minutes
<BR>turned towards the sea and waiting for the ideal
<BR>wave. When the surf came, he would turn right
<BR>around, ride the crest of the wave and when
<BR>it just began to break, he would deftly stand
<BR>up on his board and slide along the breaking
<BR>sides of the wave till he tumbled down with the
<BR>crashing water. Hmm...so many things to learn.
<P>We left the surfers to their sport and moved
<BR>further north through San Louis Obispo to join
<BR>US route 1 of California. This narrow route
<BR>runs right along the Californian coastline
<BR>with mountain peaks on one side and the
<BR>hillsides dropping steeply into the sea on the other
<BR>side. Along the ridges, where the hills met
<BR>sea, there were many small beaches. Some were
<BR>private, while others looked like they had
<BR>never been stepped upon. Fog rose from sea level,
<BR>travelled along the hillsides, up the mountaintop
<BR>and merged into the clouds. The road twisted and
<BR>turned along the rim of the mountains all
<BR>the way.
<P>Since the road was so narrow, one could either
<BR>drive or look, but not both at the same time.
<BR>One mistake and you drive down the slopes to one
<BR>of the beaches down below, where you basically have to
<BR>sunbath till a chopper comes along to pick you
<BR>up and put you back on the road up above!
<BR>Just kidding...driving wasn't that bad but was
<BR>reasonably challenging.
<P>We stopped by at many turnouts and took pictures.
<BR>There were private properties at weird locations
<BR>along the hillsides. One of the houses was
<BR>constructed on a wooden plank jutting out of the
<BR>slopes onto the sea. The driveway from the
<BR>highway to the house was a steep drop along the
<BR>incline.
<P>Nearing Monterey, we could see a thunderstorm
<BR>few miles away in the sea travelling parallel to
<BR>us. Numerous lightning flashes went all the way
<BR>to the surface of water. I hoped that the storm
<BR>wouldn't cross our way till Sunnyvale which,
<BR>by the way, was where we were planning to camp
<BR>for the night at the house of my friend
<BR>V. Narasimha Rao (VNR as everyone calls him).
<P>On the way, we got a view of Hearst Castle
<BR>perched on the top of a hill. It looked like
<BR>one of the old castles of England and Pedro
<BR>told me that it was built by some millionaire
<BR>by the same name who didn't know what
<BR>better thing to do with the money he had.
<BR>Apparently its supposed to be a spooky place
<BR>and there are trips from the bottom of the
<BR>hills that take visitors through the castle.
<BR>We didn't have much time today to share with
<BR>the ghosts that inhabited this place and
<BR>after promising them we'll come back later
<BR>to scare their wits out, we moved on.
<P>Drove further up north into Santa Cruz. This was
<BR>a small town which looked like a slightly run down
<BR>middle class town, not as well-off as Santa
<BR>Barbara, and mostly inhabited by Hispanics.
<BR>We tried to locate the downtown. Signs were really
<BR>confusing and pointed towards downtown in all
<BR>directions. Finally we found ourselves by the
<BR>seashore which had a pier, a beach with folks playing
<BR>volley ball, some restaurants and a fake casino
<BR>where people didn't play with real money. Quite
<BR>a peaceful place on a cloudy evening except for
<BR>a little while when all seagulls started
<BR>screaming their throats out for reasons only
<BR>they knew.
<P>Finding out way out through the maze of signs
<BR>in Santa Cruz, we headed towards Sunnyvale
<BR>to VNR's house. A bunch of towns around
<BR>San Jose - Sunnyvale, Palo Alto, Cupertino,
<BR>Mountain View, Redwood, Milpitas and Fremont -
<BR>along with Stanford University comprise the famed
<BR>Silicon Valley. As we entered the Silicon
<BR>Valley, the was a tangible change in surroundings.
<BR>The ads on the radio started chirping
<BR>about anything-and-everything-dot-com with
<BR>each one offering some or the other form of
<BR>internet service. Offices along the way
<BR>belonged to some software company or the other.
<BR>Silicon was in the air. All signs indicated
<BR>this placed belonged to the hi-tech minded.
<P>Sunnyvale seemed to teeming with Indian
<BR>and Chinese software professionals.
<BR>I could see more Indians and Chinese around than
<BR>Americans. But for the Spanish and English names
<BR>of the streets, one can easily mistake this for
<BR>another country. This was a spacious locality.
<BR>Even the side streets were three lanes wide!
<BR>Something unimaginable around New York area.
<P>Following the directions I had got from VNR,
<BR>we located VNR's house. VNR was my ex-colleague
<BR>at Wipro Infotech in Bangalore and like every
<BR>other Indian software professional, he is here
<BR>making his customary pilgrimage to the Silicon
<BR>Valley working with Veritas. But unlike most others,
<BR>he steadfastly refuses to apply for a green card
<BR>and wants to go back to India. We were meeting
<BR>after two years and after introducing Pedro, and
<BR>reminiscing about old times and catching up on
<BR>who is where, we headed out for dinner. Another
<BR>friend of VNR, again ...you guessed it...a
<BR>software professional from India who was new
<BR>to U.S., joined us and we went to ...you guessed
<BR>it...an Indian restaurant :) Pedro was used to
<BR>Indian cuisine by now - courtesy Stony Brook's
<BR>Curry Club - and promptly looked for Saag in
<BR>the menu. After dinner, we went home and I dozed
<BR>off like a log.
<P>Next morning VNR left early for office. We packed up
<BR>and left for Richmond which is where my future apartment
<BR>was located. On the way we saw the San Francisco
<BR>skyline and passed by exits which pointed to Berkeley.
<BR>After moving into my apartment, me and Pedro headed
<BR>for a trip to San Francisco. Crossed the bay
<BR>using the long San Raphael bridge and headed south on
<BR>101 south towards the famous Golden Gate Bridge.
<P>Just ahead of the bridge the road went up the sides
<BR>of a hill to an area called Golden Gate
<BR>National Recreational Area. From the top, the hill
<BR>overlooked the red suspension bridge with
<BR>the city's skyline and Alcatraz prison in the
<BR>background. Its a grand view, very beautiful.
<BR>Golden Gate Bridge spans over the gap of sea
<BR>where water from the Pacific Ocean flows into
<BR>San Francisco bay. Ships use this route to enter the
<BR>bay from Pacific to ports in Oakland and Richmond.
<BR>On turning my back to the bridge, I could see scenic
<BR>ridged hillsides dropping into the Pacific ocean.
<BR>The fog from the sea was just about to move into
<BR>the bay, so we were lucky to get a clear view.
<BR>I have visited this location many times over since
<BR>then and each time I get to see a different sight
<BR>of the bridge with the backdrop of the city.
<P>We drove over the bridge, into San Francisco. Our
<BR>first stop was at Marina by the sea shore. We stopped
<BR>at Round Table Pizza for lunch and for the first
<BR>time I played music from a juke box in the restaurant
<BR>while we waited for the pizza. This part of the city
<BR>was very relaxed. We parked out car near the pizza
<BR>shop and walked up the streets. Buildings along the
<BR>Marina had very uniform architecture - three to
<BR>four storeys high, mostly painted white with
<BR>ornate windows protruding from semi-hexagonal corners.
<P>Our next stop was at the most famous street of
<BR>San Francisco - the Crooked Street( real name
<BR>Lombard Street). Its a hard bricked red street
<BR>and is called crooked because it starts
<BR>from the top of a small hill, called Russian Hill,
<BR>and winds down steeply like a snake. The sides
<BR>of the road are planted with small rose gardens
<BR>and there are residential houses built in typical
<BR>San Francisco style on both sides. People who
<BR>visit this street in their car drive from the
<BR>to of the hill to the bottom. Others, like us, who
<BR>use their feet, walk along the side of the road
<BR>to the bottom of the hill and have their
<BR>pictures taken against the background of the
<BR>curving road. Its like an unending ritual that
<BR>repeats thousand times a day with every visitor
<BR>who comes here.
<P>Nearby down the hill was Fisherman's wharf -
<BR>an colorful street by the seaside with lots of
<BR>places to eat, traffic mingling freely with the
<BR>crowd on the street, and&nbsp; many guys performing
<BR>tricks in the middle of the street to make their
<BR>living.
<P>Thus we wrapped up our tour to San Francisco.
<BR>I planned to go to VNR's place for the night
<BR>and on the way dropped Pedro at San Franciso
<BR>airport. He had to now fly back to
<BR>Portugal through New York and his flight was
<BR>at night.
<P>Pedro had been an ideal travel partner
<BR>and a great company throughout the trip.
<BR>But for him, it would have been impossible for me
<BR>to make this trip of a lifetime. He had experience
<BR>travelling all over Europe and that proved to be
<BR>invaluable. Always planning the trip to the last
<BR>details, our next stops, estimated times, and
<BR>providing me with excellent driving tips. Most
<BR>important of all he knew how to find most
<BR>interesting spots in new places - so essential
<BR>to having fun in the trip. Hats off to a great
<BR>guy with great pluck!
<P>We bid our goodbye and I drove down to VNR's
<BR>house where I stayed awake late into night reading
<BR>my e-mails on the net and waking up VNR frequently with
<BR>repeated sounds of the modem resetting. This was
<BR>my first touch of a computer keyboard in a
<BR>fortnight - a fortnight away from the virtual
<BR>world of bits and bytes and in the real world
<BR>as it is.
<BR>---------------------------------
<BR>...Long has paled that sunny sky:
<BR>Echos fade and memories die:
<BR>Autumn frosts have slain July.
<P>Still she haunts me, phantomwise,
<BR>Alice moving under skies
<BR>Never seen by waking eyes.
<P>Children yet, the tale to hear,
<BR>Eager eye and willing ear,
<BR>Lovingly shall nestle near.
<P>In a Wonderland they lie,
<BR>Dreaming as the days go by,
<BR>Dreaming as the summers die.
<P>Ever drifting down the stream-
<BR>Lingering in the golden gleam-
<BR>Life, what is it but a dream?

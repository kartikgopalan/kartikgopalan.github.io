<BR>..... Anon, to sudden silence won,
<BR>In fancy they pursue
<BR>The dream-child moving through a land
<BR>Of wonders wild and new,
<BR>In friendly chat with bird or beast --
<BR>And half believe it true.
<P>And ever, as the story drained
<BR>The wells of fancy dry,
<BR>And faintly strove that weary one
<BR>To put the subject by,
<BR>`The rest next time' -- `It is next time!'
<BR>The happy voices cry.
<P>Thus grew the tale of Wonderland:
<BR>Thus slowly, one by one,......

"Alice in Wonderland"
<P>Friday Sept 3rd
<BR>---------------
<P>We woke up to a cold morning at Cody Kampground. The shower and restroom
<BR>facilities at campgrounds are common. So I treaded my way shivering
<BR>through the early morning chill but was glad that there was a hot shower
<BR>in there to warm up. The staff at the campground were serving free
pancakes
<BR>that morning we obligingly showed up at the right time to eat!
<BR>One recurring thing I noticed across all campgrounds was that these
<BR>were full of RV's or recreation vehicles. In this country, when people
<BR>retire, the grandpas and grandmas peacefully rent an RV and take off
on
<BR>a trip across the country. These RVs are huge vehicles resembling a
<BR>fully-equipped-mini-home-on-the-wheels with facilities to sleep, cook
<BR>and they even have restrooms (which get flushed out at dumpstations
that
<BR>every campground has!). RVs are typically slow moving and god save
you
<BR>if you are stuck behind driving one of these on a narrow road.
<P>Pancakes finished, time to get started. We drove into Yellowstone from
the
<BR>eastern entrance using Route 16. It turned out that this was the most
<BR>scenic route to enter the park. Yellowstone National Park was the
<BR>first national park in United States established in 1872. It covers
2.2
<BR>million acres and lies mainly in north-western Wyoming, parts of
<BR>eastern Idaho and southern Montana. Its like a strange heaven isolated
<BR>from the rest of the world. A fee of $10.00 at the entrance allowed
<BR>us to drive around the park for 7 days. That's peanuts for this amazing
<BR>place. Loops of roads have been constructed in the shape of an "8"
and
<BR>we entered from the eastern side of the bottom half of the "8"....and
<BR>our plan was to traverse the entire stretch of 8 and get out through
<BR>the southern entrance by the end of the day into Grand Teton National
park.
<BR>That was too ambitious a plan.
<P>Soon after entering, we were on mountainous roads and driving amid
<BR>thickly wooded dark pine forests. The first amazing sight was that
of
<BR>snow capped peaks with small glaciers that are sources of rivers in
<BR>this park (I haven't been able to figure out exactly which peaks
<BR>these are)...okay, but this was my first sight of a glacier, even if
<BR>from quite some distance. Driving further, we stopped by Sylvan
<BR>Lake...very clear and still water with the pine trees around the
<BR>banks and snow capped mountains getting reflected in the water.
<BR>Pedro said the place reminded him of Switzerland. This was just the
<BR>beginning of a series of wonders we were to see.
<P>The pamphlets given to us at the gate warned about approaching wildlife
<BR>in the park. This place is supposed to have grizzly bears, bisons,
elks,
<BR>coyotes, deers, and what not. The park has a daily newspaper, which
talked
<BR>about methods to protect oneself from bear attacks. After scanning
<BR>through the techniques, Pedro decided we should buy a pepper spray
which
<BR>can be used to spray on the bear and confuse it while we make our
<BR>getaway! It later turned out that the spray costs $75 ... urghhh :)
<BR>Even the garbage cans everywhere are specially designed to be
<BR>bear proof. We didn't see any bears, but lots of bisons and some elks.
<P>Next the road took us by the banks of the huge Yellowstone lake
<BR>which covers a significant portion of the park. Soon we came across
small
<BR>hot gysers. All along the banks of the blue lake, steam rose up in
the air
<BR>through vents in the ground. We stopped at many places and once I
<BR>dipped my hand in the lake's water to check the temperature....
<BR>...aiiieee... the water was cold, sorry no surprises here :) Close
<BR>to some of the vents where the steam rose, I felt the ground with my
palm
<BR>and that was much warmer than normal. Later I learnt that this was
a
<BR>dangerous thing to do since new vents are known to open up suddenly
from
<BR>ground and bursting steam can cause burns. Anyway...cool experience!
<P>Next stop was a the Fishing Bridge which situated where water
<BR>flows into Pelican Creek from the Yellowstone Lake. The interesting
fact about
<BR>this bridge is that some strange fishes (I forget the name) annually
swim
<BR>against the current and up the strong rapids of the stream and mate
at the
<BR>mouth of the lake. Since fishes are plenty in the mating season, many
<BR>pelicans visit the area to feed on them. As soon as this was noticed
by
<BR>our bright early adventurers, they built a bridge across the mouth
of the
<BR>stream and hordes of tourists flocked to this place to start fishing.
Soon
<BR>the fishes got scarce and the pelicans vanished too! These days fishing
is not
<BR>permitted on the bridge but it is at many other places in the park
if
<BR>you have a license. They call it a fishing bridge anyway. Apparently
pelicans
<BR>did return after a gap of 60 years. Later we stopped by the rapids
downstream
<BR>where the fishes are supposed to perform their heroic jumps upstream.
<BR>There weren't any jumping right then but it was a nice place all the
same.
<P>There was a very small hill near the bridge and I was just contemplating
<BR>about climbing up the hill to get a better view of the lake when a
bisonappeared at the top. This was a huge hairy beast who had apparently
lost
<BR>his way while grazing merrily. It slowly climbed down the hill
<BR>and upon suddenly encoutering so many people, got confused and started
<BR>running across the bridge. Soon the crowd around the bridge was all
<BR>excited..., all traffic on the bridge slowed down, some teenaged girls
<BR>started shouting in high frequency like mad for some strange reason,
and
<BR>people pulled out their cameras and camcorders. Anyway, the poor creature
<BR>got all scared and ran across the bridge in the middle of traffic and
back
<BR>into the forests. Some guy who didn't get to record this encounter
ran into
<BR>the forest behind the bison with a camcorder in his hand. Don't know
if
<BR>he actually came back out or became a grizzly's lunch. :) Anyway, the
<BR>bison gone, I climbed the hill, got an unimpressive view and got myself
<BR>`Patel` photographed against a warning sign - "You are in bear country..."
<BR>- that warned about recent bear sightings in that area. That was as
<BR>close as I ever got to a bear in the whole trip!
<P>Next we stopped at Lake Village where we had cofee and I bought
<BR>binoculars which I was missing sorely while looking at grand views.
<BR>Now onwards, I had these two equipments - camera and binocs -
<BR>almost permanently hanging down my neck.
<P>We drove further up north on the 8 loop. Next stop were Mud Volcanoes.
<BR>Again this region is a thermally active region with semi molten
<BR>rocks as close as 3 to 5 miles below the ground at some places. These
mud
<BR>volcanoes keep bubbling with hot water mixed in mud. There are
<BR>many caves here that resound with heavy gurgling sounds of hot water
<BR>in agitation. At some places even the parking lot had caved in with
<BR>new fissures erupting all the time. Nearby was a Sulphur Caldron
<BR>which ...well..smelled sulphur really badly. I really wanted to
<BR>explore the extensive trails further inside but, as Pedro
<BR>rightly kept pointing out, we just didn't have enough time :(
<BR>Anyway I resolved to be back sometime later for a week's trip and
<BR>take every damn trail this place had to offer. Further down,
<BR>we got a view of a grassland along the slopes of a hill
<BR>with a big herd of bisons peacefully grazing away
<BR>and I got a closer look at them with my binoculars.
<P>So we drove along to the next stop, The Grand Canyon of Yellowstone.
<BR>From what I gathered, this is where Grand Canyon extends right
<BR>into Yellowstone. Two falls, Upper and Lower lie at the head of
<BR>the canyon. Its an amazing sight. We saw the canyon from
<BR>multiple locations, the Inspiration point,&nbsp; Grandview point
<BR>and Lookout point. The walls of the canyon are colored red blended
<BR>with black - the color being due to iron deposits. There's
<BR>a steep 1600 feet descent to the bottom where a small stream flows.
<BR>I used my newly acquired binoculars extensively to view the
<BR>different rock formations. The Lookout point gives a great view
<BR>of the Lower falls. Well...in a sense then, I did after all visit
<BR>the Grand Canyon!
<P>Now it was getting close to evening and we had hardly covered
<BR>a quarter of the distance of the 8 loop. So we pushed along directly
to
<BR>Mammoth Hot Springs. Along the way there were numerous interesting
<BR>places like Antelope Creek, Tower Falls, Petrified Tree,
<BR>Blacktail Deer Plateau that I wished I could have seen.
<BR>But there was no way we could have seen them all in the little time
<BR>we had. Along the drive it appeared as if much of the forest was
<BR>recovering from a recent fire. Extensive tracts of forests were now
<BR>just black dead barks of pine trees. There were whole mountainsides
<BR>that were covered with nothing but naked stumps and branches. And
<BR>forest was showing renewed life signs with very small pine trees
<BR>growing at the bottom.
<P>Mammoth Hot Springs is a small valley in the midst of a group of
<BR>tall ranges with, well, a bunch of hot springs. These hot springs
<BR>were bigger and more glamorous than the ones I had seen at
<BR>Thermopolis. We spent quite some time going around the place.
<BR>The different formations resulting from the deposits and growing fungi
<BR>under the hot water flow from the springs were a treat to photograph.
<BR>A group of professional photographers were busy adjusting their
<BR>tripods and shooting the colored formations from various angles.
<BR>There were a group of inns below in the valley with direct view
<BR>of the mammoth springs. While driving out of the place, I saw what
<BR>I thought were statues of Elks sitting and standing in the lawns of
<BR>the inn. However these perfectly still Elks started moving slowly
<BR>as if coming back to life from stone. It was camera time and
<BR>I got some great pictures.
<P>It was now close to twilight and we had to reach Moran
<BR>campgrounds before night. We still had not seen the most famous
<BR>feature of Yellowstone - the geysers. So we decided to head to the
<BR>camp and return to Yellowstone the next day again to see the
<BR>geysers. It was a long drive. On the way I could see perfectly
<BR>heavenly scenes - streams flowing&nbsp; through creeks,
<BR>serene yellow grasslands contrasting the greenery behind,
<BR>perfectly still lakes where anglers stood still in knee deep
<BR>water waiting for a catch - as if blending into the stillness
<BR>of the surroundings, views of valleys down below with steam
<BR>rising from earth into horizon. And all the while I just wished
<BR>we had more time. We ran into rain which would suddenly
<BR>stop when we were on the other side of a hill and reappear
<BR>when we came back. It soon grew dark and after some tense
<BR>driving through the rain on the narrow roads of the forests,
<BR>we got out of southern entrance of Yellowstone. After some more
<BR>driving through a no man's land with almost no direction signs
<BR>on the road we reached Moran campgrounds. Here we again took
<BR>a wooden cabin and after dinner of cold burritos, bread and cheese,
<BR>went off to sleep. Plan for next day....geysers of Yellowstone
<BR>and Grand Teton National Park.

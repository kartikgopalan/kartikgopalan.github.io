<BR>Sun Sept 5th
<BR>------------
<P>In the morning at KOA kampgrounds by Bear Lake, I peeped
<BR>out of the tent just to have the cold chill hit my face.
<BR>That really woke me up. There was a thin sheet of ice on top
<BR>of our car. Pedro said it was too cold to sleep, whereas I
<BR>had slept like a log. Someone in a tent opposite to ours
<BR>was still snoring heavily. Another couple nearby were cooking
<BR>their breakfast and endlessly washing their vessels
<BR>by a tap nearby(they were still doing that when we left the
<BR>site half an hour later). Rest of the camp was up and alive.
<BR>All sites were packed with RVs and tents, kids running around
<BR>in tri-cycles, pets being let free in a small fenced yard
<BR>for their morning ablutions, and humans getting ready for
<BR>their share of water sports at Bear Lake. We got ready and
<BR>headed away from Bear Lake towards Salt Lake City. The road
<BR>away from town climbed up a hill and at the top we got a
<BR>magnificent view of the clear blue Bear Lake.
<P>This was a long drive through Utah. This part of the country
<BR>has cities, towns and villages situated in one valley after
<BR>another. Roads mostly passed through valleys and crossed
<BR>a brief stretch of hills before entering another valley.
<BR>Most towns are really small, often with a population of a
<BR>few hundred people. One of them had a population of 17
<BR>(seventeen)! These towns seemed to have been built around the
<BR>highways and each would typically last for a mile's stretch
<BR>along the road. Each town had a sign board declaring
<BR>"Historic Site" with no other description and pointing in
<BR>some general direction into the town. We started seeing
<BR>these signs with such regularity that it became a game
<BR>for me and Pedro to locate towns that did not have a
<BR>"Historic Site"!
<P>One of the towns had tall monastery with two rising
<BR>pillars overlooking a scenic valley. We figured this must
<BR>be a Mormon temple. About 70% of the population of Utah
<BR>belongs to a special sect of Christianity called Mormons.
<BR>In early 1800's,&nbsp; their religious leader - Joseph Smith -
<BR>got revelations when he was 14, organised a band of followers
<BR>in Ohio and moved to Jackson, Missouri which he called
<BR>Zion - some similarity to the Promised Land of Israel.
<BR>They moved further to Illinois as they got persecuted
<BR>by governments.&nbsp; Later a section of the group split and
<BR>were led by Brigham Young on a difficult trip to the
<BR>Great Salt Lake&nbsp; in Utah where he founded the Salt
<BR>Lake City.
<P>So with much hope, we drove into Salt Lake City. The lake
<BR>itself lies to the northwest outskirts of the city. We decided
<BR>to spend time in the city instead. The whole city appeared
<BR>deserted on the labor day weekend. All shops
<BR>were closed, only a few homeless people on the
<BR>streets - dead city. We parked our car and decided to walk
<BR>around. Just a week ago, a couple of blocks in the center of the
<BR>city had been hit by a tornadoe. I was hoping none would
<BR>hit while we were around! The city appeared to be a rich
<BR>place by all appearances. Neat clean streets, tall
<BR>buildings with fancy exteriors - just no one around. Only
<BR>the homeless lying without purpose on the streets belied
<BR>its richness. It was like one of the desolate cities they
<BR>show in Star Trek in which Captain Kirk and his crew try
<BR>to find adventure.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And though the shadow of
a sigh
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May tremble through the
story,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For `happy summer days'
gone by,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And vanish'd summer glory
---
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It shall not touch with
breath of bale
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pleasance of our fairy-tale.

<P>The main and perhaps the only attraction of the city is
<BR>a huge Mormon temple. We decided to visit that later.
<BR>First it was lunch time and we were hungry. We hunted around
<BR>for a restaurant but all were closed. In the process we saw
<BR>the Town Hall of the city where only visible souls seemed
<BR>to be dozing off under the sun in the lawns. More fancy buildings
<BR>and empty streets - actually it felt good walking through the
<BR>deserted streets, but I wouldn't want to live here. Finally we
<BR>located a Greek restaurant in a street corner where the Cchef
<BR>told us that city was like this every weekend. I ordered
<BR>a Calzone while Pedro ordered a Pizza. We were the only
<BR>customers in the restaurant, yet it took half an hour to get
<BR>hold of the goodies.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hush-a-by lady, in Alice's
lap!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the feast's ready,
we've time for a nap:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the feast's over, we'll
go to the ball--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Red Queen, and White Queen,
and Alice, and all!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(..LC again)
<P>It felt like we were caught in a&nbsp; time warped city where
<BR>nothing happens. After an unending lunch, we headed towards
<BR>the Mormon temple. The temple has a grand entrance and has
<BR>neat interior compound. Visitors are not allowed into the
<BR>main temple but there are a few prayer halls around where
<BR>one can enter and even take pictures. There were many guides
<BR>all too eager to help with questions. One of them was taking
<BR>visitors on a guided tour and I joined the group in anticipation.
<BR>She took everyone's introduction and then stood&nbsp; there silently
<BR>and smiling benignly waiting for something. I thought Pedro was
<BR>getting restless to move, so I left the tour for next time.
<BR>Getting out of the temple, there were a group of teenage
<BR>hippies with colored hairdos and rings sitting on the
<BR>pavements. Suddenly one of the girls yelled at me "You know
<BR>what? I hate this city. This city sucks!". Dumbfounded
<BR>at this unexpected outburst directed at me-total-stranger, I
<BR>decided to it was wiser to leave this claim uncontested
<BR>and moved on to a nearby Border's Bookstore where me
<BR>and Pedro had coffee. Following that, we drove
<BR>out of Salt Lake City as quickly as possible.
<P>Again it was a long long drive through one scenic valley
<BR>of Utah after another. We camped in Pedro's tent at KOA
<BR>kampground in Beaver. Beaver is located just north of
<BR>Zion National Park - our destination for the next day.

27th Aug.
<BR>---------
<BR>The day before we left, me and Pedro visited the local malls and bought
<BR>an odd assortment of items ranging from a hammer, some spanners, cooling
bag,
<BR>a rain repellant coating for car's windshield, and lots of eatables
for
<BR>the way. In my hurry I had forgotten to buy a camera, but since I had
<BR>a disposable one for the moment from my earlier visit to a Mets/Cardinals
<BR>game in NY, I decided not to worry about it till later in the trip.
<BR>How could one miss out a camera from shopping list before leaving on
such
<BR>a trip?? ... well, that's me :) 
<BR>
<P>28th Aug
<BR>---------
<BR>Saturday morning of 28th Aug. we were all set to go. I bade goodbye
to
<BR>my housemates and we drove off to the nearest gas station where I bought
<BR>a gauge to measure tyre pressure. It was a nice, sunny and perfect
day to
<BR>set out on the trip. We took the Northern state parkway out of Long
<BR>Islang into New York city. Once we joined the road leading to George
<BR>Washington Bridge, the going was really slow at the rate of 10 miles
per hour.
<BR>It was to be the slowest drives in the whole trip. I am not a great
fan
<BR>of New York traffic and was glad to be getting away from it for a long
<BR>long time. Driving on the upper deck&nbsp; of GW bridge, I got my last
sight
<BR>of the impressive Manhattan skyline.
<P>We took Route 80, which actually goes all the way west to San Francisco
<BR>if you bother never to get out of it. But that's not really what an
<BR>adventure is made of, is it? Our destination for the day was to reach
my
<BR>brother's place in Penn State university by the evening. The drive
through
<BR>New Jersey was absolutely boring. Only thing good about the drive
<BR>is that the gas prices are one of the lowest I have seen anywhere in
U.S.
<BR>But then they offset it by charging tolls once too often.
<BR>Once we decided to stop for lunch, it was impossible to find an exit
<BR>with a decent food joint. Finally we located a Diner and Pedro decided
to try
<BR>out american chilli for the first time. It proved to be hot in both
ways
<BR>- spicy and burnt his tounge! I stuck to a good old omellette. Another
stop
<BR>at a CITGO gas station which was run by a sardarji, and we entered
<BR>Pennsylvania. This part of the trip was much better with a great drive
<BR>through the lush green hills. I started cliking away with
<BR>my disposable camera.
<P>It was more or less an uneventful drive the first day and we reached
<BR>State College by 7:00 in the evening where my brother Venkat ( or Venky
as
<BR>we call him) and his wife Veena stay. Veena had cooked a great multi
<BR>course Indian dinner in anticipation of our arrival. Her cooking skills
<BR>are absolutely incomparable and this was the last proper dinner we
were
<BR>to have for rest of the trip! The VVs showed great interest in our
trip
<BR>plan and the places we were to visit on the way, and Venky's refrain
was
<BR>that he was envious of and happy for me as I was doing what he had
long wanted
<BR>to do.
<P>29th Aug.
<BR>----------
<BR>Early morning next day, we bid our goodbyes, bought some foodstuffs
<BR>and drove out of State College with the arrangement that I was to call
VVs
<BR>every night wherever I stopped on the way. See...guardian angles :)
<P>It was a long drive out&nbsp; to the border of Pennsylvania as the state
is
<BR>really wide! Route 80 itself is quite beautiful in this stretch but
we decided
<BR>to explore further and took side roads which basically ran parallel
to the
<BR>interstate but passed through countryside towns and villages. There
were
<BR>signs of deer crossing all along the roads, but the only deers we saw
were
<BR>those that had been run over by some passing vehicle. Too bad. Towards
the
<BR>western border of Pennsylvania, the hills began to fade away and were
replaced
<BR>by a more regular terrain.
<P>Next we entered Ohio and we were again on the interstate 80, with traffic
much
<BR>sparser and consisting mostly of trucks. Myself and Pedro had been
<BR>swapping our driving turns whenever we stopped for gas, food or at
rest areas.
<BR>The rest areas for public are really neat along the highways, something
<BR>that impressed me a lot. Some even have free coffee for sleepy drivers!
<BR>Neither of us had really stretched the vehicle very much, partly because
of the
<BR>speed limit and also because we were aware that it was loaded - you
<BR>could say it was "back heavy". On the stretch of Ohio, the limit got
higher
<BR>around 70 mph and I figured out that a loaded Hyundai could do 80 mph
plus
<BR>with ease. With good reason Pedro kept warning me to slow down.
<P>Pedro : "After reaching San Francisco, drive at whatever speed you want,
but
<BR>not on the way!".
<BR>Me : "Yes sir!".
<P>We had been on the interstate for too long and wanted to take
<BR>some side roads. Pedro decided to navigate by intuition and gave me
<BR>directions to drive in the general direction towards north.
<P>&nbsp;Me : "Hey, do you know where exactly we are on the map right now?".
<BR>&nbsp;Pedro : "No. But don't worry. Just keep driving as I tell you?".
<BR>&nbsp;Me : "Have you been here before?".
<BR>&nbsp;Pedro : "No."
<BR>&nbsp;Me : "Huh?!"
<P>And so we went on, driving thru a lot of side roads. For the benefit
<BR>of those readers outside U.S., each road in this country is identified
by
<BR>a number, as you must have figured out by now. I choose not to list
them in
<BR>this account for obvious reasons of that being uninteresting...so you'll
<BR>find the phrase "we drove thru lot of side roads" recurring throught
my
<BR>accounts.
<P>Suddenly I found myself driving by the shore of what appeared to be
a sea?
<BR>For a moment I was zapped since I thought we were driving towards
<BR>the middle of U.S. Soon I figured out that this was Lake Erie, one
of the
<BR>five in Grate Lakes region and also the source of famous Niagra Falls
that
<BR>I had visited a few weeks earlier.&nbsp; I now gained a healthy respect
for Pedro's
<BR>sense of direction. Later throughout the trip, whenever we entered
<BR>a new township or city, I'd give over the controls to Pedro. He would
<BR>locate the downtown for the town in no time using his `sixth sense'
<BR>and take us where the action in the town really was. Cool.
<P>The shores of Lake Erie seemed to be inhabited by rich people. There
were
<BR>many private beaches and sporting activity seemed to abound. Quite
a
<BR>beautiful area. We reached Sheldon where there is&nbsp; a protected
area called
<BR>"Brown Marshlands". I had never seen a marshland before so this was
a new
<BR>experience. This area is known for rare birds, insects and plants.
The
<BR>air was filled with sounds of crickets. Walk along a mile of narrow
road
<BR>took us along the sides of the marshland. Brown surface of marshes
<BR>were absolutely plain without any frills and from a distance, it was
hard to
<BR>tell whether it was solid land or just some dirt covering the surface
of
<BR>a pond. The road led to Lake Erie. We hung around for a while around
<BR>an abandoned NASA pumping station by the shore and while running to
escape
<BR>some waves, I almost disposed off my disposable camera into water.
<BR>Found our way back to route 80 and and just drove then onwards towards
<BR>Elkhart, Indiana where we had booked a room in Best Western Inn for
the night.
<P>Another feature peculiar to the stretch of roads this far was that we
had
<BR>to pay tolls very frequently all along route 80. The more toll they
charged,
<BR>the worse the roads used to be. Thus far, all trucks in Penn and
<BR>Ohio used to stay on the right lane and travelled well below speed
limit.
<BR>This gave me the impression that truckers in this country are really
well
<BR>behaved and care about safe driving. Once we entered Indiana, it seemed
as if
<BR>cops don't patrol these highways at all. For the first time in the
whole trip,
<BR>we had trucks overtaking us at 90 mph. More trucks overtook us at higher
<BR>speeds in this stretch than anywhere in the whole trip. And for those
who
<BR>don't know, trucks in this country are really big and long .... not
like
<BR>the rickety small ones that speed on India's highways. Passing by a
truck, you
<BR>feel like you are passing by a train ... okay I am exagerating but
that kind of
<BR>sums up the way it feels to be driving besides one of these dinasours.
<P>Anyway, we reached safely at Elkhart. The inn was nice and had even
had
<BR>an indoor swmming pool. Pedro, a swimming enthusiast, had his face
lit up
<BR>at the news but soon changed his mind when he saw that it was a small
pool
<BR>and even that had a bunch of kids jumping around in water. We moved
into
<BR>our room, checked out the weather for next day which seemed okay, but
had
<BR>rain predicted later in the week in our journey,&nbsp; had dinner outside
and
<BR>planned our trip next day to Chicago and Madison.
<P>(to be continued...)

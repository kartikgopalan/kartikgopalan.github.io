Wed. 1st Sept.
<BR>-------------
<P>Woke up to a great morning at Chamberlain in South Dakota along the
banks of Missouri. I got up early,
<BR>got ready, and had coffee along the river banks. On the other side
of the river Chamberlain town was
<BR>enveloped in mist that hung halfway through a bridge across the river.
Went for a walk alone to shoot some
<BR>photos of Missouri waking up lazily to sunrise. I wasn't disappointed
with what I got to capture
<BR>in my films. I went back to the hotel room for a quite breakfast while
Pedro scoured the beautiful
<BR>river banks for some more time.
<P>Soon we were driving westwards again on interstate 90 towards Badlands.
This stretch of South Dakota is
<BR>again basically lots of farms and grasslands. And we kept driving along
the monotonous terrain, I began
<BR>wondering whether the famed beauty of South Dakota was overhype. But
one thing I learnt on this
<BR>trip is never to underestimate the power of this land to shake you
out of slumber with the power of
<BR>magnificent contrasts and surprises. I came upon the contrast I wouldn't
forget in a hurry. Amid miles
<BR>of grasslands and farms, a group of naked cliffs jutt into sky to present
an amazing contrast. These
<BR>are the Badlands, very strange looking bunch of mountains having veins
along the sides created by ages
<BR>of erosion.
<P>The native Indians and later the French independently named it as Badlands
since they
<BR>couldn't use the land for any purpose. Later this place was found to
be rich in dinausaur and other
<BR>ancient fossils and became a protected region. This terrain very much
resembles the Chambal Valley in India,
<BR>probably only more colorful. Our first sight was a splendid overview
of the Badlands from the periphery.
<BR>Soil erosion has caused the volcanic sediments to erode over half a
million years and exposed various layers
<BR>of soil along the sides of the hills - red, yellow, maroon, brown,
violet (!). Great place for photography.
<BR>A thin stretch of well maintained roads took us on a loop around and
into Badlands with many places
<BR>to stop for scenic overlooks. There were many hiking trails going into
the heart of the hills and I
<BR>wished I could stay longer and go along one of these - but I was just
passing by this place - couldn't
<BR>afford to stay longer!
<P>We left badlands towards Rapid City. Badlands followed us a long way
and and slowly faded
<BR>into grasslands. We drove into Rapid City around 3:00 p.m. and pedro
quickly located its downtown
<BR>with his action sensing radars. This place seemed to have less population
than Sioux Falls city but
<BR>had more activity and liveliness. This place had lots of shops and
streets with German sounding
<BR>names but I coudn't figure out if it had any German historical influence.
<BR>Lots of students seemed to be walking around in streets, many with
painting canvasses and
<BR>musical instruments. We entered a small restaurant and ordered Cafe
Mocha
<BR>and sat observing the strange place. The restaurant was a bright place
with had lots of modernist
<BR>paintings hanging on the walls. A shelf in the corner had a bunch of
books on phiolosophy and art.
<BR>On one side were a bunch of computers with somebody tring to set up
network connection among them.
<BR>A student sat in a table in front of us reading seriously. Someone
upstairs was practicing
<BR>loud guitar, again nd again going over the same tune trying to get
it right. There were a bunch of
<BR>CDs on sale with songs from some local band. A group of teens entered
the place who seemed very
<BR>friendly and happy - they seemed to know everyone around the restaurant
... this seemed like a local
<BR>hangout for these kids more than a restaurant. A happy place that felt
good and which somehow stood
<BR>out in my memory of the whole trip.
<P>We left Rapid City and entered Black Hills nearby where there's Mount
Rushmore with the faces
<BR>of four presidents carved out on a steep rock cliff. It was close to
evening&nbsp; and Black hills
<BR>looked really black - they are thickly wooded with dark green pine
trees. We encountered
<BR>steep curvy mountain roads for the first time in the trip and this
was the beginning of a long
<BR>mountain drivong test that my car was to survive through for the rest
of the trip. We reached
<BR>Mount Rushmore and had a look at the faces of presidents from various
vantage points. It seemed
<BR>like such a crazy idea to carve out faces of presidents on a rock cliff
in a virtually
<BR>no-man's land. Apparently this was a big national project at the time
it was done and
<BR>Saouth Dakota's official slogan now read "Great Places, Great Faces!".
There was even a mini
<BR>demonstration by a guide that explained how the faces were sculpted
on the rock face.
<BR>It began raining and we decided to head out of the place. First drive
through rain
<BR>in our journey. Black Hills are a great place to drive through. We
stopped at scenic Potoma
<BR>Reservoir that fed water to Rapid City and surroundings.
<P>Our next stop was Deadwood. A small township, but very strange place.
Situated in the middle of
<BR>Black Hills, it is more of a tourist township with a thriving Casino
business. It started
<BR>out as a gold mining township and soon gambling became the favorite
pastime for the folks. They
<BR>have legends all over the town about different great gamblers who inhabited
the town and
<BR>their famous stories. There was a monument for one such guy who, the
stone claimed,
<BR>was shot to death by some other gambler. The night life in the town
was just picking up
<BR>when we arrived there. Many casinos had flashy cars outside as rewards
for winning a jackpot.
<BR>Many old men and women dressed fashionably roamed around and seemed
to be having a good time
<BR>at these places.
<P>Driving out of Deadwood and onto the interstate, I felt a strange feeling
- like I was Alice
<BR>in Wonderland - jumping into one rabbit hole after another with a different
fairyland
<BR>in each hole, a different experience. I was entering one strange place
after another, each a
<BR>completely unique emotional experience and quickly getting out of it,
all packed into
<BR>such a short period of time. Felt like I was looking at all this from
way up above in the sky,
<BR>and it seemed such a strange world to have such different things packed
in a small place
<BR>called Earth! Interstates roads seemed like the only a long, lonely
and sane places on this planet.
<P>We drove into Spear Fish where we had a room booked and rested for the
night.

So here's Part III of the trip - my visits to Chicago and Madison.
<BR>I intended to cover more but this itself proved to be pretty long.
<BR>Looks like its going to take more than five parts :)
<P>Enjoy the reading!

<P>Monday 30th Sept
<BR>----------------
<P>We started off from Elkhart after a continental breakfast at the inn
<BR>and headed straight to Chicago. Chicago and New York had very
<BR>similar histories. Both are supposed to have started as
<BR>an industrial townships. Chicago basically had coal and oil industries.
It
<BR>was also center of labor struggles. Later, as happens to all industrial
<BR>towns, Chicago and NY evolved to be strong financial trading centers
in
<BR>U.S. As we got into the outskirts of Chicago, it had dull grey and
<BR>uninviting looks with industries dotting the horizon. There were huge
<BR>power cables going&nbsp; into the city from all directions in the sky
and
<BR>innumerable trucks&nbsp; heading into the city from all directions
on the road.
<BR>We drove further inside the city where people seemed to have houses
and
<BR>soon were on neat roads. We&nbsp; drove on one by the side of Lake
Michigan and
<BR>stopped for a while by the lake to get a view of the Chicago skyline.
In
<BR>lakeside areas people seemed relaxed and laid back even at 11:00 in
the
<BR>morning of a Monday. No one seemed to be in a hurry.
<P>The main feature of the city were the distict skyscrapers. Each was
amazingly
<BR>shaped. The typical Chicago architecture seemed to have tall building
<BR>with sharp tapering tops piercing into the sky - each one making a
<BR>loud statement of its glory.
<P>We parked our car in a public parking and started walking around. I
took
<BR>lots of pictures - mainly buildings. Since I was still using my
<BR>disposable camera, one of our goals in Chicago was to buy a good camera.
<BR>Pedro seemed very excited and rushed around from street to street
<BR>as if he knew the place. I got a good excercise chasing him! In the
<BR>process I saw a lot more&nbsp; of downtown Chicago than I would have
seen by
<BR>myself.
<P>A funny and queer thing about Chicago is that they have statues of cows
<BR>all over the downtown. Each cow is painted with funny colors and patterns.
<BR>One had all its internals illustrated like assembly line of a factory
<BR>where milk is produced and the process it goes through! Some sense
of humor!
<P>After a lot of running around, we visited a local AAA office to get
more maps,
<BR>and I finally bought a proper camera&nbsp; - a simple point and shoot
Konica
<BR>with zoom and some extra focussing features. We left Chicago around
lunchtime
<BR>with lot of crowd getting out of their offices and headed towards
<BR>Madison in Wisconsin.
<P>Wisconsin didn't seem to have many big cities. The only other prominent
<BR>city seemed to be Milwaukee. Madison itself is a very small city. It
has
<BR>the state capitol whose dome dominates the city skyline according to
<BR>city's laws. The stretch of capitol is sandwiched between two big
<BR>lakes and is very beautiful. Small residential area surround the
<BR>capitol building.&nbsp; The whole city seemed extremely laidback
<BR>and sleepy. The University of Wisconsin at Madison too is by one of
the lakes.
<BR>Again we parked our car and started walking around the streets and
visited
<BR>banks of each of the lakes.
<P>As the evening hours started approaching, the streets became much livelier.
<BR>A lot of undegraduate crowd, probably freshmen joining in the Fall,
<BR>appeared on the streets from nowhere and soon it was a party atmosphere
<BR>by the shopping streets and restaurants. A lot of houses belonged
<BR>to fraternities and sororities named as Alpha Kappa Lamda, and whatever
<BR>combinations of any three greek letters you can make out. Fresh kids
<BR>in college hung out on the balconies and shouted across to each other.
<BR>One of the houses appeared burnt - probably a drunken saturday night
party!
<P>We left Madison around sunset and headed towards La Crosse where we
planned
<BR>to stay for the night. Part of the way, we took a smaller side road
and
<BR>were rewarded with the sight of a beautiful countryside with glorious
<BR>sunset over&nbsp; its cornfields. Unfortunately, I had no more film
rolls with me :(
<BR>We passed through Baraboo and Sauk City which were small sleepy townships
with
<BR>an economy depending on tourists and passing traffic on the highway.
Went by a
<BR>casino which had amazingly large number of cars parked in its parking
lot
<BR>for the sparsely populated countryside. For the first time we had a
taste of
<BR>night driving for a couple of hours.
<P>We reached La Crosse at night. Its a small town by the border of Wisconsin
<BR>and Minnesotta. We checked into a motel,had dinner at Pizza Hut and
went off
<BR>to sleep. Plan for next day - drive across Minnesotta - "The Land of
10000
<BR>Lakes".
<P>.....more to come....

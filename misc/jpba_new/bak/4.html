Here's the account my drive across Minnesotta. A day in which
<BR>I didn't see any big places, but had a lot of fun anyway.
<P>- Kartik
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Tuesday 31st Aug
<BR>----------------
<BR>Woke up at La Crosse and left the motel after breakfast.
<BR>We picked up some more eatables form a local grocery store
<BR>where the people were more friendly than I had seen
<BR>so far in the trip. We roamed around a sleepy towship which
<BR>wasn't up even at 10:00 a.m.&nbsp; We went to the banks of
<BR>junction where three rivers -Mississippi, Black, and La Crosse -
<BR>meet each other. There was a huge statue of Hawaiatha
<BR>native Indian by the river. So I stood in front of
<BR>the statue and Pedro took a snap of an alien Indian standing
<BR>in front of a native Indian! Also went through a small
<BR>museum which had the history of La Crosse. Apparently the
<BR>French were the first from Europe to arrive in the area
<BR>and they set up lots of lumber businesses around the place.
<BR>Mississippi river served as a means of transporting the timber
<BR>to downstream locations.
<P>We drove out of La Crosse and into Minnesotta. The number plates
<BR>on the car ahead of us declared "Minnesotta - a land of 10000 lakes".
<BR>Indeed we saw many lakes along the places we passed by. Northern part
<BR>of the state is supposed to be more scenic and from the maps
<BR>it appeared to have more lakes. But we were driving along the
<BR>southern border of Minnesotta and this region was mostly
<BR>great plains and prairies. It was miles and miles of farmand as
<BR>far as eyes could see. Around noon, we stopped by a small mid-western
<BR>town named Albert Lea. It was a somewhat run-down small township
<BR>besides a lake. This town had many flat roofed concrete buildings,
<BR>many of them painted bright red, which was different since most towns
<BR>in eastern side have wooden houses with tiled, tapering roof.
<BR>We went to a local post office where Pedro wanted to mail something.
<BR>While he was in line, I had a good time observing a confident
<BR>and cute&nbsp; 2 yr old native Indian kid giving his mom a hard time
<BR>by trying to pull off all booklets and envelops within his reach.
<P>We checked out a small family run pizza shop. The hostess was
<BR>nice and friendly. Apparently not many foriegners or "out of towners"
<BR>come to this town. So she asked as to where we were from. When I mentioned
<BR>Long Island, she immediately started talking about the
<BR>JFK Junior's plane crash near LI and how sad she felt for him. JFK
<BR>Junior seemed to be a heartthrob among women in America.
<BR>More than once I have heard american women reminiscing about him fondly.
<BR>The pizza was good and we tipped her well!
<P>Off we drove out of Albert Lea towards a place called Sioux Falls.
<BR>We didn't know whether there were any falls at all. Tourbook
<BR>mentioned a Falls park in the city. So we went. About 50 miles
<BR>before Sioux Falls, we decided to take a small sideroad. This
<BR>road had no signs as to where it went or where all those turns lead
to.
<BR>So we stopped by a small run down gas station. The area seemed quite
<BR>poor with mostly local trucks stopping by. The girl at the station
<BR>filled the gas and cleaned the car's windshield. When I asked for
<BR>directions to Sioux Falls, she called her friend from inside. The reason
<BR>I mention these details is that the this second girl had
<BR>green eyes - the greenest I have ever seen in a human being. That
<BR>combined with her serious looks appeared really spooky. While
<BR>she explained the route to us in a heavy mid-west accent, the first
<BR>girl got a souvenir for us from inside - it was a plastic tablet
<BR>with the name of the gas station painted on it.
<BR>"Its something for you remember us by. We don't see that many out
<BR>of towners around here!" Me and Pedro had a small contest later
<BR>as to who gets to keep the souvenir...I did!
<P>Pedro wasn't convinced that the directions we got took on through
<BR>an interesting route. So as soon as we got out of the gas station,
<BR>he promptly took another route and drove by intuition. As always,
<BR>his intuition was right. We passed by beautiful farmlands and
<BR>reached Sioux Falls city. This was a somewhat bigger city
<BR>with much more activity around evening time. I was still wondering
<BR>if there were any falls around the place. We took
<BR>directions to the falls park and came across a small waterfall
<BR>with a nicely maintained park around it. There wasn't much water around
<BR>this time of year. We hung around for a while and climbed a tower
<BR>nearby to get a view of the city. Sioux Falls started off as
<BR>an industrial township that grew around the Big Sioux river.
<BR>Now it was a prominent business center. There used to be a seven
<BR>storeyed wheat processing mill besides the water fall in early 20
<BR>century that derived its power using water from the falls. They still
<BR>had the ruins of the mill. Pretty cool stuff for that time.
<P>Drove around a little bit more and left the city by taking a small
<BR>sideroad. Somewhat rough road with no traffic in sight for miles
<BR>and miles. Just plain farmlands. At places I saw some storage towers
and
<BR>farmers' houses nearby. I was wondering how it would be living
<BR>in one of these places and had a strong urge to stop by
<BR>one of these farmhouses and stay there for a week or so in their
<BR>lifestyle. But that would have to wait for sometime later. Right
<BR>now I was in a rush to go across the country and could only hope
<BR>for a glimpse of this remote life.
<P>I was rewarded with another beautiful sunset with a purple sky and
<BR>this time I promptly took photographs. We joined interstate 90
<BR>and drove to Chamberlain. Its a town by Missouri river - basically
a
<BR>tourist attraction. We had not booked a place this night so we hunted
<BR>around till we came across a somewhat expensive inn called Cedar Shores
<BR>just on the scenic banks of Missouri. Pedro and me were in a dilemma
<BR>whether to take the room at such an expensive place and decided it
<BR>was probably worth it. Resolved to camp the following nights to
<BR>make up for it! I took a shower at the room, had dinner, and I went
<BR>out to the river shore while Pedro decided to go off to sleep. After
<BR>spending some time&nbsp; by the shore watching the reflection of town's
<BR>lights in Missouri's flowing waters, I went back to the room resolving
<BR>to get up early the next morning to catch the sunrise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>(to be continued...)

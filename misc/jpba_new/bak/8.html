...getting there...but not quite yet!
<P>Sat Sept 4th'99
<BR>---------------
<P>The morning at Moran camp had a little surprise.
<BR>Out behind the clouds, we could see outlines of the
<BR>magnificent snowcapped peaks of Grand Teton. A closer
<BR>look at them was for later in the day. We drove through
<BR>the no man's land and could see much more in daylight
<BR>than we could driving the previous night. The plan
<BR>for the day was quite simple. Visit the geysers
<BR>of Yellowstone, get back to Grand Teton national Park,
<BR>spend the day there and then camp at Bear Lake.
<P>The most famous geyser in Yellowstone is the
<BR>Old Faithful geyser. It is so called since for ages
<BR>it has been spewing out huge bursts of water at an interval
<BR>of more or less every 45 minutes to one hour. There
<BR>are a bunch of other geysers around Old Faithful
<BR>that are not so faithful, but quite magnificent
<BR>when they do erupt. Back at the entrance of YellowStone,
<BR>we asked the guard about the timing of next eruption
<BR>for Old Faithful. Surprisingly she didn't know!
<BR>Anyway, if we had to see it, we had to see it, no
<BR>matter how long the wait.
<P>After a long drive through the forests of
<BR>Yellowstone, we reached Old Faithful village.
<BR>There are extensive walkways constructed
<BR>around the geysers with Old Faithful being the
<BR>center of attraction. The information center
<BR>declared that OF was to erupt in ten minutes.
<BR>So me and Pedro blended into the waiting crowd,
<BR>everyone ready with their cameras and camcorders.
<BR>The geyser itself is like a big boil on the
<BR>surface of earth with a cone at the center.
<BR>Steam rose from the cone and water kept
<BR>splashing out sporadically as the water pressure under
<BR>the ground steadily built up. Every time,
<BR>a big splash occurred, the crowd would get restless
<BR>hoping this would be THE eruption. When the eruption
<BR>did start, it was nothing like I have ever seen before.
<BR>Huge volumes of hot water shot up to 30 feet from
<BR>surface like an enormous fountain. An amazing sight.
<BR>The eruption lasted for almost five minutes before dying
<BR>down. Great pictures.
<P>Having paid our respects to the Old Faithful, we moved on
<BR>to other geysers. There were innumerable of them. Some
<BR>were small fissures in the ground. Some were big pools with
<BR>a small fountainlike spring in the center and a floor with
<BR>sky blue color. Some looked like cancerous wounds on the
<BR>earth's surface. One was shaped like an ear. The walkway
<BR>passed so close to one of the erupting geysers that
<BR>water sprayed over me - not as hot as I expected. There
<BR>was a Grand Geyser which erupted once in 12 hours.
<BR>Some erupted once in a few days. One was shaped like a
<BR>castle and showed considerable activity. Very interesting
<BR>and unique place.
<P>Happy at having seen the most famous feature of Yellowstone,
<BR>we moved on towards Grand Teton. Grand Teton lies just
<BR>south of Yellowstone. One more journey southwards on the
<BR>same path to get out of Yellowstone. But this was more
<BR>rewarding. The road going south on the western side of 8 loop
<BR>crosses the continental divide thrice. Continental divide
<BR>is basically a fault in earth's crust on American continent
<BR>that runs from north to south all across. As a result,
<BR>streams originating on the eastern side drain in the
<BR>direction of the Atlantic Ocean whereas streams originating
<BR>on the western side drain towards the Pacific. We stopped
<BR>by one of these locations where there were actually two streams,
<BR>one draining in east and other in west. Absolutely cool
<BR>effect! Again I got myself `Patel` photographed against the
<BR>signpost, pretending to hold the divide together.
<P>The road approaching Grand Teton provided an amazing
<BR>frontal view of the mountain ranges. Our ticket for Yellowstone
<BR>was valid to Grand Teton as well - great deal for 10 bucks.
<BR>The national park is basically a valley surrounded by the
<BR>Teton mountain ranges that tower over its background. Ages
<BR>ago there was no valley, but after some major earthquakes and
<BR>shifts in tectonic plates, the surface caved in
<BR>creating what is now a beautiful valley. To reach the ranges,
<BR>one has to hike on extensive trails, something for which we didn't
<BR>have much time. All the same we decided to take a smaller trail
<BR>besides Jenny Lake which led to Hidden Falls. To reach Jenny Lake,
<BR>we had to drive through the middle of the flat valley populated
<BR>by tiny shrubs and millions of crickets making their typical sound.
<BR>It was great pulling out at some spots and getting to look at the
<BR>towering ranges on all sides. My binoculars found
<BR>extensive use again in exploring the nitty gritty details
<BR>of the glaciers that sat cosily near the peaks.
<P>Near Jenny Lake, we parked our car and started out
<BR>on the trail. People returning on the trail seemed flush
<BR>and happy and every passer by wished a friendly "hi" or "hello"....
<BR>something strange but refreshing for me-straight-faced-New-Yorker :-|
<BR>There were many old people who took the trail with enthusiasm.
<BR>Many families with 3 and 4 year olds in the group too. It was a
<BR>long 3 mile trail through thickly wooded forests that took us
<BR>along the banks of Jenny Lake on one side and steeply rising
<BR>sides of the Teton ranges on the other side. Initially I was
<BR>in a rush to reach the falls as soon as possible but soon
<BR>realized that was not the way to enjoy a hike. So I slowed down
<BR>and took my time clicking photos of wild berries and flowers
<BR>and watching canoes and motorboats on the peaceful lake.
<BR>Finally we heard the wooshing sounds of
<BR>the falls. True to its name, I couldn't see the falls even when
<BR>the sound&nbsp; of water seemd to surround the forest and streams
<BR>flowed out from evrywhere. Only after getting very close
<BR>and from certain angle, I could see the falls. It wasn't
<BR>very impressive, perhaps because this wasn't the season for
<BR>excess water. We hiked back on the trail, more slowly than
<BR>before. Passed by a father with four toddlers having a tough time
<BR>convincing them to walk the rest of the trail. Lot of
<BR>folks heading towards the falls kept asking us how far it
<BR>was...and so we walked on till we reached the parking lot,
<BR>had coffee watching the mountain ranges and drove out.
<P>As the sun was setting behind the Teton ranges, the whole valley
<BR>was bathed in golden yellow with long shadows of the
<BR>ranges slowly creeping upon the valley. It was the most beautiful
<BR>sunset behind the mountains I have seen. Unfortunately I had
<BR>exhausted my stock of film rolls...so no pictures of this amazing
<BR>scene :(
<P>Pedro meanwhile switched on the FM channel on the radio to
<BR>check if any stations reach this remote place and surprisingly we
<BR>could catch a few. One of the poplar songs was playing.
<BR>Its a different kind of song in which the lead guy "speaks"
<BR>out light philosophical advice (very similar to the TODAY'S GEMS
<BR>from Srichie :) with music in the background. One of the
<BR>advice he gave was "Live in New York some time in your life
<BR>but leave before it makes you too hard. Live in
<BR>Northern California sometime in your life, but leave before
<BR>it makes you too soft!"....and here I was...bang...relocating
<BR>between exactly these very two places!
<P>As we drove further, the roads took us through one valley after
<BR>another, each one more beautiful than the other. Mountains
<BR>surrounding the velleys were yellow and the valleys themselves
<BR>were covered with golden grasslands or had farms with tiny
<BR>hamlets sitting in the middle. Light from the setting sun would
<BR>fall at an angle from behind the mountains and paint the
<BR>valley with magical golden and orange hues. Amazing beauty.
<P>We passed through final miles of wilderness of Wyoming
<BR>and covering a small stretch of Idaho into Utah. It was night
<BR>when we reach the KOA kampgrounds at Garden City which is by
<BR>the banks of Bear Lake. It was the Labor Day weekend and the
<BR>campground was packed with outdoor loving holiday crowd with
<BR>their RVs and water-sport gears. There were many high school going
<BR>kids working that night at the camp managing the customers on their
<BR>bikes and holding starwar-like green torchlights in their hands. We
<BR>managed to rent one spot&nbsp; of ground just enough to pitch Pedro's
<BR>tent for the first time in the trip. Pedro unpacked his camping
<BR>gear. Since I had no prior experience setting up a tent, I stood
<BR>by showing the torch light while he unfolded the tiny package
<BR>and assembeled it into a neat tent. Took many precautions to
<BR>prevent flies from getting into the tent. It was a cold night, close
<BR>to 40 Farenhite. I slept soundly, tired from the day's 6 mile hike.
<BR>But Pedro felt the chill and didn't sleep. When we woke up in the
<BR>morning next day, there was a thin sheet of ice on the roof
<BR>of the car...
<P>...but more about next day the next time - our journey through
<BR>the promised land of Mormons into The Salt Lake City.

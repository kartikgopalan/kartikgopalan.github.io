<BR>Monday 6th Sept
<BR>---------------
<P>Packed our tent for one last time in the trip today.
<BR>Pedro and me had decided to ditch our plans for a
<BR>grand finale at Grand Canyon. Felt Pedro couldn't
<BR>catch his flight from San Francisco on 10th if
<BR>we went there. Plus we had seen one too many canyons
<BR>and creeks on the way to be able to do justice to Mr. GC.
<BR>But hey, just north of it and not that far was Las Vegas.
<BR>So we decided to make a go for it tonight. It was
<BR>a long distance from where we were. But then LV's
<BR>got to be seen by night or not at all. So let's go!
<P>Our first stop for the day was to be at Bryce Canyon
<BR>situated in Dixie National Forests. The vegetation
<BR>along the drive was getting to be much sparser
<BR>and more shrub like scattered over the hilly
<BR>terrain of Utah. Apparently northern Utah gets a
<BR>lot of snow in winter. One of the license plates
<BR>on a Utah vehicle had declared "The best snow on
<BR>earth!". Skiing must be a popular sport in this
<BR>state. Anyway, the weather this particular day
<BR>didn't give any suggestion that this land receives
<BR>snow. We were on lower altitudes and it was
<BR>getting hot as ever.
<P>Following directions to Bryce canyon, we passed
<BR>through a short stretch of plains and ...what did
<BR>I tell you?...this land surprises you with sheer
<BR>breathtaking contrasts. Across the horizon, we could
<BR>see a line of grey hills rising out of ground
<BR>and behind the grey hills, a stretch of completely
<BR>red peaks rose even higher. The only piece missing
<BR>in the scene was a full orchestra in the background
<BR>as we approached the hills growing bigger on us!
<BR>Ok..enough hyperbole! We were at the entrance to
<BR>Dixie National Forests. The Red Peaks visible from
<BR>afar belonged to the Red Canyon which extends for a
<BR>couple of miles from the entrance. Weird
<BR>formations have formed on the hillsides due to
<BR>erosion over time. I immediately jumped out of
<BR>car and started taking pictures. The drive
<BR>through the Red Canyon was followed by more flat
<BR>lands for next 20 miles before we reached Bryce
<BR>Canyon. Bryce Canyon is situated in a land
<BR>where water is scarce. But the snow in winter
<BR>seeps in as water into cracks in rocks. There is
<BR>a wide variation in temperature here during an
<BR>average day. As a result, the rocks break down
<BR>over time and the canyon keeps widening and
<BR>churning out completely weird formations.
<P>Apparently the best time to view the canyon
<BR>is at sunrise or at sunset when the light plays
<BR>tricks with eyes creating brilliant illusions
<BR>of colors on these red rocks. Dah! We were here
<BR>in the afternoon in searing heat and there was
<BR>nothing that could be done about that. But
<BR>guess what? The best pictures I took in the
<BR>whole trip came from the Bryce Canyon! The afternoon
<BR>sky was clear blue and contrasted perfectly against
<BR>the red walls of the canyon. We decided to take
<BR>a&nbsp; three mile trek through the canyon. Starting
<BR>off from Sunrise point, we climbed down the
<BR>slopes. Grand view of a group of rock formations
<BR>that looked like carefully placed pieces on
<BR>a chess board. There were natural holes punched
<BR>on the sides of the canyon that looked like
<BR>bridges. The bottom of the canyon had trails
<BR>of a dry stream. The end of the trek at Sunset point
<BR>was an extremely steep climb 850 feet up the
<BR>sides of canyon for more breathtaking views.
<BR>With time only to cover this fraction of the
<BR>portion of Bryce, we drove out, back through
<BR>the Red Canyon and towards Zion Natinal Park.
<P>Zion is another natural wonder. At the entrance
<BR>to the Zion, there are a set of hills. Its as
<BR>if each is made out of single rock and someone has
<BR>carefully placed very very regular deep rectangular
<BR>stripes across all its sides - most strange hill
<BR>I have ever seen. Its called Chequerboard Mesa.
<BR>Drive further into Zion took us through a series
<BR>of tunnels with high rocky hills on all sides.
<BR>The longest of the tunnels was 2 Kms long.
<BR>(And yes! for some strange reason, they started
<BR>using the metric system here to mark the
<BR>distances. Only place in U.S. so far where I
<BR>have seen metric system being used.) It was a
<BR>single lane one way traffic in the tunnel with
<BR>the traffic in one direction being stopped till
<BR>a group of vehicles from the other direction cleared
<BR>through. The Zion Canyon is somewhat ensconsed
<BR>and hidden away in the middle of the forests. It
<BR>must have taken considerable persistence on part
<BR>of the early adventurers to reach here. Beyond
<BR>the tunnels began our descent to the base of
<BR>the canyon. The narrow road going down had
<BR>frequent hairpin bends. Halfway down, I could
<BR>see strange big arches cut into the rocky
<BR>walls of the canyon - like someone's great
<BR>throne.
<P>At the bottom, the road follows the Virgin
<BR>River in a long scenic drive. This Monday being
<BR>a Labor day holiday, there was considerable crowd
<BR>and as a result, lot of vehicular traffic. Cars
<BR>were parked at all possible nook and corners
<BR>along the road and I wondered if this was more
<BR>like a picnic area than a protected
<BR>national forest. With so many man made constructions
<BR>that I saw along the canyons bottom, I just had to
<BR>conjure up images in my mind of how the place
<BR>would have looked like before man stepped in here.
<P>Our first stop was at the head of a trail which
<BR>went up half amile along the canyon's walls to
<BR>a place called Weeping Rocks. This is a great
<BR>arch on the walls on the canyon with water from
<BR>some small stream dripping down slowly along
<BR>its edges. All kinds of strange creepers, fungi and
<BR>plants grow besides on the walls so that they
<BR>are called the Hanging Gardens. We could actually
<BR>walk under the dripping water and into the shade
<BR>of the arch to observe the place. The place was
<BR>pretty slippery, still a bunch of toddlers and
<BR>kids were jumping around in water and slush having
<BR>a great time. One of the parents told his 5 year
<BR>old girl not to get wet by going under the falling
<BR>water. The girl promptly proceeded to get herself
<BR>drenched under the tiny waterfall and called after her
<BR>father "Dad! Why don't you come in too? Its
<BR>real fun!!"
<P>Next we drover further to the tip of canyon - a place
<BR>called "The Temple of Sinawava". Its a semi circular
<BR>area surrounded by high rocky walls with small streams
<BR>flowing in from around to join the Virgin river.
<BR>The place was absolutely packed with cars with no
<BR>parking space and people having picnic all around the
<BR>stream. We couldn't get a parking spot there and decided
<BR>to head back through the canyon. Halfway through, we
<BR>stopped to take a 2 mile trail to a set of three pools
<BR>called the "Emrald Pools" - the upper, middle and
<BR>lower pools. I proceeded ahead alone as Pedro went
<BR>searching for something at a nearby lodge and said he
<BR>would follow me. The trek took me along the rim of the
<BR>canyon and provided great overlooks of the rocky faces
<BR>of the canyon from various points. Pedro caught up
<BR>with me pretty soon. We visited the
<BR>middle and the lower pools. One had to trek 3 miles
<BR>further to reach the upper pool and there was no time for that.
<BR>I would rather call them "puddles" of water since
<BR>there is little water flowing along the streams at
<BR>this time of the year. But the trek peaceful.
<BR>Back at the bottom of the canyon, we had coffee at
<BR>a lodge while looking from the windows
<BR>at a magnificent view of a towering red rock face of
<BR>the canyon in front.
<P>It was getting close to evening now and our aim was
<BR>to reach Las Vegas by night if we were to get to see
<BR>its famed night life. We wanted to book a room
<BR>in advance of getting there. There were at least a
<BR>thousand rooms in each of the big lodges or hotels listed
<BR>in the tourbook. We finally located a hotel that suited
<BR>our budget. Apparently it also doubled up as a casino,
<BR>but it was supposed to be one of the lesser mortals
<BR>in the city of the rich and mighty. So from the bottom
<BR>of a deep canyon in the middle of a nowhere forest in Utah,
<BR>I dialled a number 150 miles away in a desert city
<BR>called Las Vegas and booked our rendezvous for the night!
<P>We drove out of the Zion Canyon and took the nearest
<BR>interstate freeway # 15 heading towards LV. After
<BR>crossing the Utah border, we drove through a brief
<BR>30 mile stretch of Arizona. Landscape now consisted
<BR>of absolutely barren grey hillsides. For a stretch,
<BR>we had to drive westwards and the glare from the
<BR>setting sun would blind us from the front. I
<BR>had a hard time keeping by car in the lane. The speed
<BR>limit here was 75 miles per hour and people easily
<BR>drove at 90 or 100. For our loaded Hyundai driving on
<BR>a hilly road, even 65 is a great feat! The traffic
<BR>was pretty heavy. There were signs which warned that
<BR>these highways were patrolled by aircraft. Apparently
<BR>the cops just take note down the registration number
<BR>of speedsters from up in the sky and mail a ticket
<BR>to your home address..nice, you get roasted
<BR>and you don't even realize...at least till later :)
<P>Once we entered Nevada, the landscape became more
<BR>valley like with barren hills on the horizon. We drove
<BR>through miles of desert having just small bushes and
<BR>shrubs for vegetation. At one point, we realized we
<BR>were low on gas and needed to refuel. I was warned that
<BR>in Nevada, you can drive for a couple of hundred miles
<BR>without encountering any sign of habitation, let alone
<BR>gas stations. Alarmed, we took the next exit which
<BR>showed gas with an arrow pointing into nowhere in the
<BR>forsaken desert. Many miles into the exit and we still
<BR>couldn't trace even a faintest sign of any town or
<BR>village. After about five miles, we reached a small town
<BR>by the side of a small pond in the middle of the desert.
<BR>Gas prices were, of course, sky high. While refuelling,
<BR>got to peacefully watch a beautiful sunset over the o
<BR>desert skyline. Small reward for long detour! Drove back
<BR>five miles back on the highway towards LV.
<P>By the time we reached the outskirts of Las Vegas,
<BR>it was night. In order to get into the Vegas mood,
<BR>we decided to tune into the local FM stations. Immediately
<BR>I was hearing the sounds of Frank Sinatra filtering into
<BR>car. Sinatra is apparently a legend in this city which
<BR>breathes his music every day. Ironically, one of his
<BR>numbers which I heard repeatedly here was
<BR>"New York! New York!" :) As the highway entered the
<BR>city from over the hills, down beneath in the valley,
<BR>in the center of a desolate desert, there were a
<BR>million glittering golden lights of the city. It was an
<BR>amazing and crazy sight. It required an exremely
<BR>high level ingenuity and&nbsp; insanity for someone to
<BR>land up in the middle of nowhere in a desert and
<BR>decide to erect the biggest and most famous gambling
<BR>city in the world with its two hundred thousand
<BR>inhabitants making a living out of this business.
<P>As crazy and fantastic as it appeared from a distance,
<BR>it appeared more insane as we drove into it. My first
<BR>impression of the city was that of a clown with a
<BR>perpetually smiling face mask to entertain his daily
<BR>train of customers. There was glitter and pomp
<BR>everywhere. Every neon sign was for some casino, hotel,
<BR>motel,free buffets, million dollar gambling prizes
<BR>and what not. Every inch of the exterior entire
<BR>buildings were illuminated with bright colored lights
<BR>to attract maximum attention. Even grocery stores and
<BR>gas stations had slot machines lines up so that people
<BR>could try their luck anytime, anywhere.
<P>We checked into our hotel (which had&nbsp; a decent number
<BR>of slot machines lined up from the entrance to the dining cafe).
<BR>It was a pretty good room for a cheap price.
<BR>The food and lodging in this city are supposed
<BR>to be cheap so that people can spend more money gambling.
<BR>Freshened up with a hot shower and had dinner at a nearby
<BR>Indian restaurant called "Gandhi Restaurant" - poor
<BR>Gandhiji turning in his grave. Finally we walked onto
<BR>the streets to have a taste of Las Vegas.
<BR>Many `Noveau riche` of the city drove around on
<BR>the four lane city roads in flashy convertibles,
<BR>classy limousines and loud motorbikes.
<BR>Every third car had loud music on its stereo, mad look in
<BR>the its driver's eyes, and speed in its wheels.
<BR>A merry and happily drunk couple were swaying on the
<BR>sidewalk.
<P>The crowd knew how to dress for the night. Men young and old,
<BR>in formal suits, gelled hairs, cigars in mouth and
<BR>stern straight look in eyes. Women, young and old, in
<BR>flashy dresses, high heels, fat purses. And, just like in
<BR>any other big city of U.S., there was other part of the crowd
<BR>too - homeless people in rags, mostly blacks and hispanics,
<BR>hanging around street corners, accosting passerbys for
<BR>small change, handing out advertisement pamphlets or
<BR>just lost in the world.
<P>Towering over this melting pot of people were the
<BR>tall flashy glittering multi-storeyed casinos. Ballagio
<BR>was a casino with a sprawling garden. There was a musical
<BR>fountain show every half hour in which fountains danced
<BR>to the tunes of Frank Sinatra's songs. Caesar's Palace
<BR>was another one in which they try to recreate the original
<BR>palace of Caesar. Different areas in this five-star
<BR>casino were designed to give the effect of walking through
<BR>the open streets of Rome and were called by Roman names.
<BR>The amount of money they put in to maintain this world of
<BR>make believe is amazing. Paris was a casino bult in
<BR>the shape of Eiffel Tower. The interiors resemled the
<BR>streets of Paris. The ceiling was so painted and lighted
<BR>to give the impression that we were walking under open
<BR>skies. The employees and even the customers wore typical
<BR>french dresses. Young women looking like french models
<BR>sat along the benches of this make believe streets
<BR>with cigars in their mouth and exuding typical cool
<BR>looks of the french. Another casino was called New York.
<BR>It had two building, one resembling the Empite State
<BR>building and the other resembling the Chrysler building.
<BR>There were bridges with conveyer belts connecting different
<BR>casinos to each other. This way people could move around
<BR>between casinos easily and the owners of casinos happily
<BR>shared the money these customers had to offer.
<P>The main playing area looked the same at all casinos.
<BR>Young and rich men with their women sat at table games
<BR>and played high stakes. Old retired people
<BR>sat alone at slot machines, spending away their life's
<BR>savings quarter by quarter. The continuous music
<BR>emenating from slot machines filled the background
<BR>and sounded like incantations for money.
<BR>The night shows in Las Vegas are another famous feature.
<BR>We checked the prices but it was more expensive than
<BR>we thought and we decided against it.
<P>What's visiting Las Vegas without a little gambling.
<BR>So I played exactly a dollar at one of the slot machines.
<BR>Each of the four quarters dutifully vanished into the machine
<BR>like a black hole! It had been a long day
<BR>and we stumbled back to our hotel room for a good night's
<BR>rest. Goal for the next day - cross the Mojavi desert
<BR>and hit the Santa Barbara on the west coast!

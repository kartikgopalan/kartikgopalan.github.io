2nd Sept
<BR>--------
<P>Great Day. Got out of Spear Fish. It was a cloudy morning and was threatening
to rain.
<BR>We drove into Wyoming with our final destination for the day being
Cody. At the border
<BR>of Wyoming a board declared "Welcome to Wyoming : Like No Other Place
On Earth!".
<BR>And true to its name, I haven't seen a place like this anywhere else.
Our first
<BR>encounter with Wyoming's nature was a stretch of low misty clouds that
we ran into
<BR>for a long stretch. In the limited visibility, the stretch of land
I could see
<BR>had yellow and wavy appearance. The trees and hills had a ghostlike
appearance
<BR>amid the hanging clouds. I don't have enough words to describe the
morning as it was
<BR>but it had a bewitching beauty. And since Pedro was in charge of the
wheels, I got
<BR>myself busy clicking pictures even through the dew that started forming
on the windshield.
<BR>We drove through Gillette which is an oil and coal town. Like all industrial
towns,
<BR>it had a shabby appearance. An unmanned gas station there wouldn't
accept my credit card.
<BR>A railroad station nearby didn't seem to have a soul around the place.
<P>We next drove towards Buffalo which sits at the tip of Rocky mountain
ranges. Another small
<BR>midwest town which had legends of war between native Indians and westerners.
Most Indians
<BR>got butchered in the wars and now the surviving descendants live in
reservations. It had
<BR>a war memorial for everyone from the town who had died in a fight ever
since the American
<BR>civil war. Had lunch at a restaurant called Busy Bee restaurant. It
was a small homely restaurant
<BR>where lots of old timers seemed to hang around. Everyone knew everyone
else and we seemed to
<BR>be the only strangers around the place. It was a particularly cold
day that morning
<BR>and I had to pull out my sweaters. Pedro had apparently come unprepared
for this cold - something
<BR>that struck me later as quite strange for a person initially planning
to travel in Canada!
<BR>But he insisted on roaming around in shorts and T-shirt! Brave man
:)
<P>We stopped for coffee at another shop. The girl there was friendly and
while preparing our
<BR>Cappucino she told us stories about her trip to India and China. "So
where are you guys heading
<BR>to?". "San Francisco". "Wow! That's along way from New York. So, you'll
be visiting the
<BR>whole of United States on the way. How many days are you planning to
take? A month?".
<BR>"No just 10 days. We are just passing by."&nbsp; And that's where I
got the title for this
<BR>series - "Just Passing By America"! We got directions to go to Thermopolis
from the girl
<BR>and headed out of Buffalo.
<P>Soon we drove into Big Horn national forests. These were similar to
Black forests
<BR>with mountains at high elevation. As we went higher, we ran into thick
cloud cover.
<BR>Visibility was poor again but it seemed like a dream driving through
those clouds
<BR>with only ghostly outlines of the forest and the mountains visible
to us. At the
<BR>highest elevation (exactly 9666 feet!), we got a great clear view&nbsp;
of the hills.
<BR>From this point onwards, we kept driving downhill. Suddenly we found
ourselves
<BR>driving through the middle of a creek with steep rocky walls jutting
out on both
<BR>sides and a small stream flowing through the middle. This, I later
found is, the Powder
<BR>River Pass which is at the entrance to the town of Tensleep. We just
had to stop
<BR>and get out on many of the pullouts along the road where I took many
pictures of
<BR>the creek. The road wound down along its walls and finally passed through
the
<BR>bottom of the creek providing views of the creek from every angle.
<P>Immediately after Tensleep, we drove through a long stretch of Route
16
<BR>between Tensleep and Worland. This stretch presented a stark contrast
to the
<BR>lush green Bighorn forests. At first sight I thought it was a desert.
In fact these
<BR>are the badlands of Wyoming. The land here is completely yellow and
barren with
<BR>very little vegetation. I did not see such a desolate stretch of land
again till I
<BR>reached Nevada desert. Many oil wells dotted the horizon here pumping
oil from as
<BR>deep as 10000 feet in the ground.
<P>After Worland, we reached Thermopolis - my first sight of hotsprings.
At the entrance
<BR>at the town, there is a huge banner painted on a side of a hill claiming
<BR>"The largest hotsprings in the world" with an arrow pointing to where
the hotsprings are.
<BR>Largest or not, it was very beautiful. The whole place smelled of sulphur
<BR>and I was to carry that smell in my nose well after we left the place.
Hotsprings
<BR>are basically sources of hot water from beneath the ground. Not very
far under the
<BR>ground are high temperatures from which the water gets heated and comes
out through vents.
<BR>There were quite a few pools of hot springs around the place with vapors
rising from them
<BR>as if in a fairy tale. Where the water flowed down the gradient, different
colored
<BR>fungi had grown depending upon the temperature of the water flowing
there. It looked like
<BR>a deliberate painting by an artist. Apparently, native Sioux Indians
used to have annual
<BR>ritual baths at this place till the U.S. government bought the land
from their chief for
<BR>a price of $60,000 in order to preserve the springs. At the origin
of one of the springs,
<BR>I could see hot water emerging out of the ground. The pool appeared
bottomless
<BR>with big leaf shaped dark green fungi growing along its sides. Bubbles
rose from beneath
<BR>out of nowhere making weird sounds. It was as if the hot waters were
rising right
<BR>out of hell. Totally cool.
<P>Out of Thermopolis, we drove into Wind River Canyon. Of course, Wind
River winds
<BR>through this canyon. This is also supposed to be have Indian reservations.
I even thought
<BR>I saw a teepee (Indian tent house). The drive took us through three
small tunnels.
<BR>The walls of the canyon were more majestic than in
<BR>Powder River Pass. At the end of the canyon, we came across a huge
man made reservoir.
<BR>It was a great unexpected view. As it began to rain, we headed on our
way back through
<BR>the canyon towards Cody.
<P>Cody lies right at the mouth of Yellowstone National Park. We had a
cabin booked
<BR>at one of KOA campgrounds (KOA = Kampgrounds of America). My first
stay at a campground.
<BR>Promptly became a KOA member for $10 as it meant I got 10% discount
at any
<BR>campground - it wasn't very long before I recovered the membership
fees with our
<BR>repeated stays at campgrounds. It was a neat campground and a comfortable
wooden cabin
<BR>with 4 beds, two each bunkered on opposite walls of the cabin. After
having bagels and
<BR>bread for dinner and planning our trip to Yellowstone the next day,
Pedro went off to sleep
<BR>while I sat outside on the porch in a cold night and logged my visits.

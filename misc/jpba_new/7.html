      <p><BR>..... Anon, to sudden silence won,
        <BR>In fancy they pursue
        <BR>The dream-child moving through a land
        <BR>Of wonders wild and new,
        <BR>In friendly chat with bird or beast --
        <BR>And half believe it true.
        <P>And ever, as the story drained
        <BR>The wells of fancy dry,
        <BR>And faintly strove that weary one
        <BR>To put the subject by,
        <BR>`The rest next time' -- `It is next time!'
        <BR>The happy voices cry.
        <P>Thus grew the tale of Wonderland:

      <P>Friday Sept 3rd
        <BR>---------------
        <P>We woke up to a cold morning at Cody Kampground. The shower and restroom
        <BR>facilities at campgrounds are common. So I treaded my way shivering
        <BR>through the early morning chill but was glad that there was a hot shower
        <BR>in there to warm up. The staff at the campground were serving free
        pancakes
        <BR>that morning we obligingly showed up at the right time to eat!
        <BR>One recurring thing I noticed across all campgrounds was that these
        <BR>were full of RV's or recreation vehicles. In this country, when people
        <BR>retire, the grandpas and grandmas peacefully rent an RV and take off
        on
        <BR>a trip across the country. These RVs are huge vehicles resembling a
        <BR>fully-equipped-mini-home-on-the-wheels with facilities to sleep, cook
        <BR>and they even have restrooms (which get flushed out at dumpstations
        that
        <BR>every campground has!). RVs are typically slow moving and god save
        you
        <BR>if you are stuck behind driving one of these on a narrow road.
        <P>Pancakes finished, time to get started. We drove into Yellowstone from
        the
        <BR>eastern entrance using Route 16. It turned out that this was the most
        <BR>scenic route to enter the park. Yellowstone National Park was the
        <BR>first national park in United States established in 1872. It covers
        2.2
        <BR>million acres and lies mainly in north-western Wyoming, parts of
        <BR>eastern Idaho and southern Montana. Its like a strange heaven isolated
        <BR>from the rest of the world. A fee of $10.00 at the entrance allowed
        <BR>us to drive around the park for 7 days. That's peanuts for this amazing
        <BR>place. Loops of roads have been constructed in the shape of an "8"
        and
        <BR>we entered from the eastern side of the bottom half of the "8"....and
        <BR>our plan was to traverse the entire stretch of 8 and get out through
        <BR>the southern entrance by the end of the day into Grand Teton National
        park.
        <BR>That was too ambitious a plan.
        <P>Soon after entering, we were on mountainous roads and driving amid
        <BR>thickly wooded dark pine forests. The first amazing sight was that
        of
        <BR>snow capped peaks with small glaciers that are sources of rivers in
        <BR>this park (I haven't been able to figure out exactly which peaks
        <BR>these are)...okay, but this was my first sight of a glacier, even if
        <BR>from quite some distance. Driving further, we stopped by Sylvan
        <BR>Lake...very clear and still water with the pine trees around the
        <BR>banks and snow capped mountains getting reflected in the water.
        <BR>Pedro said the place reminded him of Switzerland. This was just the
        <BR>beginning of a series of wonders we were to see.
        <P>The pamphlets given to us at the gate warned about approaching wildlife
        <BR>in the park. This place is supposed to have grizzly bears, bisons,
        elks,
        <BR>coyotes, deers, and what not. The park has a daily newspaper, which
        talked
        <BR>about methods to protect oneself from bear attacks. After scanning
        <BR>through the techniques, Pedro decided we should buy a pepper spray
        which
        <BR>can be used to spray on the bear and confuse it while we make our
        <BR>getaway! It later turned out that the spray costs $75 ... urghhh :)
        <BR>Even the garbage cans everywhere are specially designed to be
        <BR>bear proof. We didn't see any bears, but lots of bisons and some elks.
        <P>Next the road took us by the banks of the huge Yellowstone lake
        <BR>which covers a significant portion of the park. Soon we came across
        small
        <BR>hot gysers. All along the banks of the blue lake, steam rose up in
        the air
        <BR>through vents in the ground. We stopped at many places and once I
        <BR>dipped my hand in the lake's water to check the temperature....
        <BR>...aiiieee... the water was cold, sorry no surprises here :) Close
        <BR>to some of the vents where the steam rose, I felt the ground with my
        palm
        <BR>and that was much warmer than normal. Later I learnt that this was
        a
        <BR>dangerous thing to do since new vents are known to open up suddenly
        from
        <BR>ground and bursting steam can cause burns. Anyway...cool experience!
        <P>Next stop was a the Fishing Bridge which situated where water
        <BR>flows into Pelican Creek from the Yellowstone Lake. The interesting
        fact about
        <BR>this bridge is that some strange fishes (I forget the name) annually
        swim
        <BR>against the current and up the strong rapids of the stream and mate
        at the
        <BR>mouth of the lake. Since fishes are plenty in the mating season, many
        <BR>pelicans visit the area to feed on them. As soon as this was noticed
        by
        <BR>our bright early adventurers, they built a bridge across the mouth
        of the
        <BR>stream and hordes of tourists flocked to this place to start fishing.
        Soon
        <BR>the fishes got scarce and the pelicans vanished too! These days fishing
        is not
        <BR>permitted on the bridge but it is at many other places in the park
        if
        <BR>you have a license. They call it a fishing bridge anyway. Apparently
        pelicans
        <BR>did return after a gap of 60 years. Later we stopped by the rapids
        downstream
        <BR>where the fishes are supposed to perform their heroic jumps upstream.
        <BR>There weren't any jumping right then but it was a nice place all the
        same.
        <P>There was a very small hill near the bridge and I was just contemplating
        <BR>about climbing up the hill to get a better view of the lake when a
        bisonappeared at the top. This was a huge hairy beast who had apparently
        lost
        <BR>his way while grazing merrily. It slowly climbed down the hill
        <BR>and upon suddenly encoutering so many people, got confused and started
        <BR>running across the bridge. Soon the crowd around the bridge was all
        <BR>excited..., all traffic on the bridge slowed down, some teenaged girls
        <BR>started shouting in high frequency like mad for some strange reason,
        and
        <BR>people pulled out their cameras and camcorders. Anyway, the poor creature
        <BR>got all scared and ran across the bridge in the middle of traffic and
        back
        <BR>into the forests. Some guy who didn't get to record this encounter
        ran into
        <BR>the forest behind the bison with a camcorder in his hand. Don't know
        if
        <BR>he actually came back out or became a grizzly's lunch. :) Anyway, the
        <BR>bison gone, I climbed the hill, got an unimpressive view and got myself
        <BR>`Patel` photographed against a warning sign - "You are in bear country..."
        <BR>- that warned about recent bear sightings in that area. That was as
        <BR>close as I ever got to a bear in the whole trip!
        <P>Next we stopped at Lake Village where we had cofee and I bought
        <BR>binoculars which I was missing sorely while looking at grand views.
        <BR>Now onwards, I had these two equipments - camera and binocs -
        <BR>almost permanently hanging down my neck.
        <P>We drove further up north on the 8 loop. Next stop were Mud Volcanoes.
        <BR>Again this region is a thermally active region with semi molten
        <BR>rocks as close as 3 to 5 miles below the ground at some places. These
        mud
        <BR>volcanoes keep bubbling with hot water mixed in mud. There are
        <BR>many caves here that resound with heavy gurgling sounds of hot water
        <BR>in agitation. At some places even the parking lot had caved in with
        <BR>new fissures erupting all the time. Nearby was a Sulphur Caldron
        <BR>which ...well..smelled sulphur really badly. I really wanted to
        <BR>explore the extensive trails further inside but, as Pedro
        <BR>rightly kept pointing out, we just didn't have enough time :(
        <BR>Anyway I resolved to be back sometime later for a week's trip and
        <BR>take every damn trail this place had to offer. Further down,
        <BR>we got a view of a grassland along the slopes of a hill
        <BR>with a big herd of bisons peacefully grazing away
        <BR>and I got a closer look at them with my binoculars.
        <P>So we drove along to the next stop, The Grand Canyon of Yellowstone.
        <BR>From what I gathered, this is where Grand Canyon extends right
        <BR>into Yellowstone. Two falls, Upper and Lower lie at the head of
        <BR>the canyon. Its an amazing sight. We saw the canyon from
        <BR>multiple locations, the Inspiration point,&nbsp; Grandview point
        <BR>and Lookout point. The walls of the canyon are colored red blended
        <BR>with black - the color being due to iron deposits. There's
        <BR>a steep 1600 feet descent to the bottom where a small stream flows.
        <BR>I used my newly acquired binoculars extensively to view the
        <BR>different rock formations. The Lookout point gives a great view
        <BR>of the Lower falls. Well...in a sense then, I did after all visit
        <BR>the Grand Canyon!
        <P>Now it was getting close to evening and we had hardly covered
        <BR>a quarter of the distance of the 8 loop. So we pushed along directly
        to
        <BR>Mammoth Hot Springs. Along the way there were numerous interesting
        <BR>places like Antelope Creek, Tower Falls, Petrified Tree,
        <BR>Blacktail Deer Plateau that I wished I could have seen.
        <BR>But there was no way we could have seen them all in the little time
        <BR>we had. Along the drive it appeared as if much of the forest was
        <BR>recovering from a recent fire. Extensive tracts of forests were now
        <BR>just black dead barks of pine trees. There were whole mountainsides
        <BR>that were covered with nothing but naked stumps and branches. And
        <BR>forest was showing renewed life signs with very small pine trees
        <BR>growing at the bottom.
        <P>Mammoth Hot Springs is a small valley in the midst of a group of
        <BR>tall ranges with, well, a bunch of hot springs. These hot springs
        <BR>were bigger and more glamorous than the ones I had seen at
        <BR>Thermopolis. We spent quite some time going around the place.
        <BR>The different formations resulting from the deposits and growing fungi
        <BR>under the hot water flow from the springs were a treat to photograph.
        <BR>A group of professional photographers were busy adjusting their
        <BR>tripods and shooting the colored formations from various angles.
        <BR>There were a group of inns below in the valley with direct view
        <BR>of the mammoth springs. While driving out of the place, I saw what
        <BR>I thought were statues of Elks sitting and standing in the lawns of
        <BR>the inn. However these perfectly still Elks started moving slowly
        <BR>as if coming back to life from stone. It was camera time and
        <BR>I got some great pictures.
        <P>It was now close to twilight and we had to reach Moran
        <BR>campgrounds before night. We still had not seen the most famous
        <BR>feature of Yellowstone - the geysers. So we decided to head to the
        <BR>camp and return to Yellowstone the next day again to see the
        <BR>geysers. It was a long drive. On the way I could see perfectly
        <BR>heavenly scenes - streams flowing&nbsp; through creeks,
        <BR>serene yellow grasslands contrasting the greenery behind,
        <BR>perfectly still lakes where anglers stood still in knee deep
        <BR>water waiting for a catch - as if blending into the stillness
        <BR>of the surroundings, views of valleys down below with steam
        <BR>rising from earth into horizon. And all the while I just wished
        <BR>we had more time. We ran into rain which would suddenly
        <BR>stop when we were on the other side of a hill and reappear
        <BR>when we came back. It soon grew dark and after some tense
        <BR>driving through the rain on the narrow roads of the forests,
        <BR>we got out of southern entrance of Yellowstone. After some more
        <BR>driving through a no man's land with almost no direction signs
        <BR>on the road we reached Moran campgrounds. Here we again took
        <BR>a wooden cabin and after dinner of cold burritos, bread and cheese,
        <BR>went off to sleep. Plan for next day....geysers of Yellowstone
        <BR>and Grand Teton National Park.

      <p>Q : How do you eat an elephant?
        <br>A : Bit by bit.
      </p>
      <p>Here's the story of my 12 day journey from New York to San Francisco
      in the September of 1999, when I was a grad student with plenty of time but 
      little money. Without a cell phone or a GPS, armed only with a Rand McNealy Road Atlas
      and a bunch of AAA maps, I drove across this vast beautiful land and 
      fell in love with it.

      <span id = "difference"></span> years later, as much as this country has changed, it has also 
      remained the same. The ordinary people I meet are kind, welcoming, and unassuming. 
      Step out of big cities and one can't help but feel a connection to the earth. 
      The white man's pluck, the black and brown man's sufferings, and the 
      spirits of Native Americans long gone have shaped this rugged land
      into a free-spirited nation that I am only now beginning to truly understand.
      I've travelled the world and there's no place else I'd call home.
      </p>

      <p>As I started writing, I realized the account is
      going to be so huge that none of the hapless readers is going to have the
      patience to finish it all in one sitting. So I've written it in 12 parts
      to hopefully mitigate any indigestions!
      </p>

      Dedicated to my Dad, who painstakingly scanned all my trip pictures, annotated them, and linked them into the text. 
      He vicariously followed my trip from halfway across the globe, located each and every one of my stops on a Rand McNally Atlas,
      scanned the map fragments, and inserted them like a pro at just the right places in the text, all before he ever set foot in the US!

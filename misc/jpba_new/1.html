      <h2>Starting Off</h2>
      <p>"We must not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we began, and to know the place
        for the first time." - T. S. Eliot</p>
      <p>So you can say I almost
      did it! My second dream was to drive across U.S. to Grand Canyon. Aim
      for the stars and at the least you'll land on the rooftop. Well I
      drove across U.S. all right, but by the time I reached near Grand
      Canyon, I had seen so many other canyons, mountains, and rocks on the
      way that I wanted to see no more of them for some more time. So I
      went straight to Las Vegas instead for a grand finale! Even though
      the mission didn't get accomplished fully, the trip was one in a
      lifetime - 12 days, a zillion gallons of gas, staying in every type
      of motel and camps, tasting every kind of food on the way, and best
      of all getting to see almost every form of landscapes and people
      there are to see in this vast country. 
      </p>
      <p>So this is how it
      started. I had to reach Berkeley (near San Francisco) by the middle
      of September on a project for next one year. Being a grad student in
      U.S., one needs the penny-pinching mentality to survive here and I
      was trying to relocate between two of the costliest places in this
      country. With my bank balance hardly enough to ship my car 3500 miles 
      across the country it didn't take much
      time for me to figure out what the best option would be to reach my
      destination - drive myself to San Francisco. 
      </p>
      <p>Well, wanting to do
      something interesting is one thing. Getting a consensus on doing it
      is another. Why do you need a consensus for a single person? Well you
      do especially if you are the youngest in the family with many
      guardian angels looking after your welfare. Honestly, I am glad and
      thankful I have so many guardian angels and going by their advice, I
      needed to find an experienced partner to travel along. I needed to
      leave by September 1st to reach San Francisco on time and with just a
      week left for before my trip, there still wasn't anyone willing to
      come along. I couldn't expect much either. With the new semester just
      getting kicked off, who would like to miss classes, drive 3500 miles
      across the country, and fly back immediately to achieve a net
      displacement of zero in terms of distance but a big displacement in
      terms of bank balance?
      </p>
      <p>They say that if you
      want something really badly, miracles happen. And a week before the
      D-day I found just the person who would do all of the above except
      miss classes - since he had just graduated from being a grad student
      to teaching these poor souls. 
      <A HREF="pedro_kartiks_travel_companion.jpg">Pedro</A>
      was a Ph.D. student in our lab and graduated just a few months
      earlier. Like all Professors, he had decided that academic life was
      more interesting than real world! So he went back to his teaching
      position in Portugal. Now on vacation in U.S. he had plans to go
      further north to explore the wilderness of Canada. But desperate as I
      was, I gave it a long shot and asked him to drive with me instead
      across the country. Ask and thou shall receive - I have never seen
      anyone agree more promptly :) Rest is history. 
      </p>
      <p>Coping with my crazy
      last week at summer internship, I managed to get my car tuned up and
      wrap my belongings at Stony Brook. Me and Pedro paid a visit to local
      AAA office asked the poor guy at the office to carefully plan out two
      separate routes across the country for our drive from NY to SF in 10
      days visiting as many interesting places as we could. Shaking his
      head in despair, the AAA man took out a big map of united states,
      marked out every road we'd have to take on the way (most of which we
      never followed) and carefully placed green circles along the path on
      places that would be interesting to stop by. 
      </p>
      <p>My car is (or rather, was) a '95 Hyundai
      Accent 2-door hatchback and it was a feat of extremely careful
      engineering to have both mine and Pedro's belongings packed into the
      pseudo-trunk and the backseat of the car. Every item had a specific
      place to fit in and nowhere else to go. A loaded 2-door hatchback is
      not the best companion to go long-distance travelling, but it was the
      best we had and it proved to be good enough.  The route we chose was
      close to the longest one could take to reach a place diagonally
      across the country. First we were to go west half the way from NY,
      then north-west towards Yellowstone further away from our
      destination, then straight down south to Grand Canyon and then up
      north-west again to San Francisco. Armed with tourbooks and campbooks
      for almost every state on the way, and a big National Geographic Road
      Atlas, we set out on our mission.
